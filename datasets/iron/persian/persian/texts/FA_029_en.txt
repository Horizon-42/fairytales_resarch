A prince scales a glass mountain and wins a pari bride. She agrees to marry him if he swears never to take a second wife.

Back at court, a rival vizier pressures the prince to break his vow. He wavers; the pari, hurt, leaves signs to her mountain home and departs.

The prince repents, climbs the glass peak again, and passes tests set by the pari’s kin. Proving loyalty, he brings her back. The vizier is disgraced, and the marriage is restored.
