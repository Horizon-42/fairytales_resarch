Hunter Yusef sees pari maidens bathing at a mountain spring. He hides one feather cloak, stranding a pari who begs for its return. He promises protection and marriage; she agrees, asking him never to speak of her origin.

They live together and have a child. In some versions jealous relatives or a nosy guest discover the hidden cloak, breaking the taboo.
The pari takes back her feathers and must return to the sky or mountain palace. Before leaving, she leaves signs on the trail and says Yusef may follow if his love is true.
With help from an old hermit and the trail-marks, Yusef finds the pari realm and completes set tasks. The pari’s kin relent, and the couple reunites, keeping both worlds in balance.
