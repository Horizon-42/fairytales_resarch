A pepper seller is promised against her will to a harsh lord (in some tellings, a div). An old woman pities the bride-to-be and slips her three objects: a pouch of pepper, a comb, and a mirror, telling her to use them only if she must escape.

On the wedding night, the bride and a loyal servant lead the pepper seller’s donkey away quietly, carrying the three objects.
The lord/div wakes and gallops after them. The bride throws the pepper; a stinging sandstorm blinds him. She throws the comb; it sprouts into a thorn forest he must hack through. She throws the mirror; it shatters into a river of glassy shards that cut his feet, forcing him to stop.
Reaching a caravanserai, she reunites with her pepper-seller sweetheart. The community sides with the lovers, and they marry freely, having outwitted coercion.
