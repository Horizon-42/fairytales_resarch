Bald, unlucky Hassan is mocked for laziness. He leaves home, helps an old woman on the road, and learns of an ogre’s house holding treasure and a captive maiden.

Hassan sneaks in. The maiden begs for rescue and hands him a comb, a bag of salt, and a waterskin, warning him not to look back if they flee. They slip out while the ogre sleeps.

The ogre wakes and charges after them. Hassan throws the comb, which becomes a dense forest; the ogre hacks through. He throws the salt, which rises into a jagged salt-crag mountain; the ogre claws it down. He finally throws the water, which swells into a river the ogre cannot cross.

With the path blocked, Hassan and the maiden reach town. The ogre abandons the chase, and Hassan marries the clever maiden, prized now for courage and wit.
