Amir Arsalan aids a mysterious maiden who later reveals she is a peri princess in disguise. They pledge to wed, binding human and fairy courts. Arsalan is bold, but the peri guides him with hidden signs.

A rival sorcerer-king covets the peri and seizes her, spiriting her away to the fairy realm. The peri’s mother gives Arsalan a magic ring and a flying steed so he can pursue.
Arsalan rides the skies, passing enchanted gates and towers. He fights guards of steel and solves riddling tasks; in some tellings the sorcerer hurls spells after him.
The peri leaves signals—dropped scarf, marked door—that let Arsalan navigate the palace. He tricks the sorcerer, frees the peri, and escapes on the flying steed.
They return, expose the sorcerer, and marry. Their union ties human valor to peri aid, and the flying horse remains a bridge between realms.
