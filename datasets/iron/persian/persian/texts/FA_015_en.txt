An inventor brings an ebony horse that flies like a hawk. A prince learns its hidden knobs and tests it in the sky.

The prince rides far and meets a princess—often described with peri-like radiance. They pledge to marry, but a jealous sorcerer steals the horse and abducts her.
The prince recovers the horse, tracks the sorcerer, and tricks him. Using flight and wit, he frees the princess and spirits her away.
They return by air, expose the sorcerer, and wed. The ebony horse remains their bridge between realms.
