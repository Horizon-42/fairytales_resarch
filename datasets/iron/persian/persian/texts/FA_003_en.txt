Years later Sam dreams of his lost son and repents. He climbs the mountain and kneels before the Simurgh, who returns Zal on the promise he will be loved, not feared. Father and son reconcile, and Zal grows into a skilled archer and sage.
When Zal marries Rudabeh, Sam fears scandal, but the Simurgh’s feather reassures him and eases Rudabeh’s difficult childbirth by teaching a surgical cut. Zal’s life shows human and mythic realms cooperating through compassion and wisdom.
