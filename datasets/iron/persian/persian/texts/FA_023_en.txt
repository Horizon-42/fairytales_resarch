They escape the cave with riches. The ifrit wakes and races after them in a storm of fire.
Judar throws the henna; it becomes a choking fog. He throws the millet; it turns into a swarm of birds that peck and blind the ifrit. He throws the oil; it bursts into a wall of flame that blocks the path.
Beaten back, the ifrit withdraws. Judar and the ifrit’s daughter settle in the city and marry, freeing her from servitude.
