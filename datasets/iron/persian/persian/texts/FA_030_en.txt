A woodcutter sees a pari descend on moonbeams to bathe. He hides her moon-cloak so she cannot return. She agrees to marry him if he keeps it safe.

They live happily and have a child. A guest discovers the hidden cloak and reveals it.
The pari takes the cloak and must return to the sky. She leaves a silver thread leading to a mountain pass.
The woodcutter follows the thread, weaves a bridge, and proves his devotion. The pari is allowed to return with him; the cloak remains, but their bond endures.
