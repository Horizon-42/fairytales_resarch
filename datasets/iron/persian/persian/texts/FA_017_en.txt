A poor fisherman hauls up a sealed brass bottle from the sea. When he opens it, a giant jinni bursts out and swears to kill him, claiming centuries of imprisonment have twisted his mercy into rage.

The fisherman keeps his wits. He doubts the jinni could fit in the bottle and challenges him to prove it. The jinni shrinks back inside, boasting of his power.
Swiftly the fisherman stops the bottle with lead and prepares to throw it back into the sea. The terrified jinni bargains, promising wealth and safety. Only after extracting the promise does the fisherman release him.
The jinni leads the fisherman to a pond where a cursed palace hides treasure and transformation tales. Wit and caution save the weak from the strong.
