Jamasp, a poor youth, falls through a well into an underground garden. There he meets Shahmaran, a radiant serpent-maiden queen, who shelters him and teaches healing and wisdom if he keeps her realm secret.

After years below, Jamasp longs for daylight. Shahmaran lets him return above, extracting a promise of silence. He prospers thanks to the remedies she taught.
When the king falls mortally ill, the vizier claims only serpent flesh will cure him. Soldiers search cisterns; Jamasp finally reveals Shahmaran’s pool. She accepts her fate and instructs Jamasp to bathe first in her blood, then let the vizier bathe.
Shahmaran is killed. Jamasp bathes, gains her knowledge, and cures the king. The vizier dies in the second bath. Jamasp becomes royal healer, carrying the weight of betraying his serpent bride-teacher.
