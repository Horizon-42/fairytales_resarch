Aladdin is a street youth recruited by a sorcerer who claims to be his uncle. In a cave, Aladdin finds a magic lamp and discovers the jinni inside will grant his wishes. Freed from the sorcerer’s trap, he uses the lamp to bring riches to his mother.

With the jinni’s help he builds a dazzling palace and wins Princess Badr al-Budur’s hand. The jealous sorcerer later tricks Aladdin’s wife into trading the lamp for new lamps, stealing it and teleporting the palace away.
Aladdin keeps the ring-spirit, locates the vanished palace, and sneaks inside. He gives the princess a sleeping draught to disarm the sorcerer, kills him, and reclaims the lamp. He returns the palace to its place and lives in restored honor.
