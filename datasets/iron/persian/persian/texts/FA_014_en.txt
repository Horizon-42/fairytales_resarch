With the jinni’s help he builds a dazzling palace and wins Princess Badr al-Budur’s hand. The jealous sorcerer later tricks Aladdin’s wife into trading the lamp for new lamps, stealing it and teleporting the palace away.
Aladdin keeps the ring-spirit, locates the vanished palace, and sneaks inside. He gives the princess a sleeping draught to disarm the sorcerer, kills him, and reclaims the lamp. He returns the palace to its place and lives in restored honor.
