A potter’s daughter is carried off by a div to grind his flour. An old woman captive there pities her and gives her a comb, a sack of flour, and a needle to throw if she flees.

At night the daughter slips away. The div wakes and charges after her.

She throws the comb, which grows into a thorn forest. She throws the flour, which billows into a blinding fog. She throws the needle, which becomes a wall of brambles. Tangled and lost, the div gives up.

The daughter returns home and is welcomed. She marries a kind neighbor, and the old woman is later freed.
