The girl serves the div supper and sings him to sleep. She pockets the gifts and the div’s key-ring and slips away with her donkey before dawn.
The div wakes and charges after her. She throws the soap, and the path becomes a slippery hill of foam; the div slides. She throws the comb, which grows into a thorn forest; he claws through. She throws the needle, and a wall of briars rises; the div’s hide is torn and he gives up.
The girl reaches home with the key-ring of treasure. Her family and neighbors celebrate her wit and courage; she keeps the donkey as her loyal helper.
