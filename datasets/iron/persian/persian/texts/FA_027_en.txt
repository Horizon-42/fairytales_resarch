A youth rests beneath a cypress and sees a pari maiden emerge from the trunk at moonrise. They fall in love; she agrees to marry if he keeps her tree-born origin secret.

They live happily until a rival mocks her origin. In anger, the youth blurts the secret.

Bound by the broken taboo, the pari fades back into the tree, leaving a token and a trail of petals leading to her realm.

The youth follows the trail, completes tasks set by her kin, and wins permission to bring her home. Trust replaces secrecy, and they reunite.
