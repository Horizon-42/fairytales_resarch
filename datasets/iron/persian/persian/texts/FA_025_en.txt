Hassan the rope-seller is hired by an ogre and finds a captive peri maiden. She warns him the ogre will kill him and begs to flee. She gives him ashes, a thorn twig, and a jug of water for escape.

They run. The ogre wakes and charges after them.

Hassan throws the ashes; they spin into a blinding dust storm. He throws the thorn twig; it grows into a barrier of briars. He throws the water; it becomes a river. The ogre cannot cross and turns back.

Hassan brings the peri to town. She keeps her human form; they marry, ending the ogre’s threat.
