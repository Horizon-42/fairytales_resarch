Talkhab loves Shirin, but she is promised to a harsh lord. An old woman pities Shirin and gives her a pouch of pepper, a spindle, and a flask of water, telling her to use them only if she must flee.

On the wedding night, Shirin and Talkhab slip away with a loyal servant. The lord wakes and pursues on horseback.

Shirin throws the pepper, raising a blinding sandstorm. She throws the spindle, which becomes a steep mountain ridge. She throws the water, which spreads into a wide river the pursuer cannot cross.

Cut off and stinging, the lord turns back. Shirin and Talkhab reach a neighboring village, where they marry freely with community support.
