A childless couple prays for a child. A hollow tree opens and a baby girl is found within. They raise the tree-born maiden with care.

As she grows, a prince discovers her singing by the tree. He marries her despite whispers about her uncanny origin.

A jealous co-wife or rival harms or replaces the tree bride. The true bride survives as a dove, a branch, or a disguised servant, watching her place taken.

With help from tokens of the tree or a faithful ally, she is recognized. The rival is punished, and the prince restores the tree-born bride to honor.
