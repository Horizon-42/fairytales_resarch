They cross scorching deserts, meeting a talking bronze statue that warns them to turn back.\nThey pass petrified corpses that serve as moral lessons about greed and pride. Magical beasts and dried-out wells test their resolve. At last they reach the sealed City of Brass, its gates inscribed with warnings that power fades.\nInside they find royal halls empty, queens turned to glass, and tablets that recount how arrogance angered fate. Taking a few relics, they leave humbled. The story ends with a sermon on mortality and the limits of worldly might.",
