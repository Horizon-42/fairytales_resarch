He promises protection and marriage; she agrees, asking him never to speak of her origin.\n\nThey live together and have a child. In some versions jealous relatives or a nosy guest discover the hidden cloak, breaking the taboo.\n\nThe pari takes back her feathers and must return to the sky or mountain palace. Before leaving, she leaves signs on the trail and says Yusef may follow if his love is true.\n\nWith help from an old hermit and the trail-marks, Yusef finds the pari realm and completes set tasks. The pari’s kin relent, and the couple reunites, keeping both worlds in balance.",
