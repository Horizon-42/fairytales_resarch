First he met a Brahman, and to him he gave a cake, asking him to point out the road to Ram; but the Brahman only took the cake and went on his way without a word. Next the farmer met a Jogi or devotee, and to him he gave a cake, without receiving any help in return. At last, he came upon a poor man sitting under a tree, and finding out he was hungry, the kindly farmer gave him his last cake, and sitting down to rest beside him, entered into conversation. \"And where are you going?\" asked the poor man, at length. \"Oh, I have a long journey before me, for I am going to find Ram!\" replied the farmer. \"I don't suppose you could tell me which way to go?\"",

Nevertheless, the money-lender determined to have the conch by hook or by crook, and as he was villain enough not to stick at trifles, he waited for a favourable opportunity and stole the conch. But, after nearly bursting himself with blowing the conch in every conceivable way, he was obliged to give up the secret as a bad job. However, being determined to succeed he went back to the farmer, and said, coolly, \"Look here; I've got your conch, but I can't use it; you haven't got it, so it's clear you can't use it either. Business is at a stand-still unless we make a bargain. Now, I promise to give you back your conch, and never to interfere with your using it, on one condition, which is this,—whatever you get from it, I am to get double.\" \"Never!\" cried the farmer; \"that would be the old business all over again!\" \"Not at all!\" replied the wily money-lender; \"you will have your share! Now, don't be a dog in the manger, for if you get all you want, what can it matter to you if I am rich or poor?\"",

This was too much for any farmer to stand; and our friend brooded over it, and brooded over it, till at last a bright idea came into his head. He seized the conch, blew it loudly, and cried out, \"Oh, Ram! I wish to be blind of one eye!\"",
