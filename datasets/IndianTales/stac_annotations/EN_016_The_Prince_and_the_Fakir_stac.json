But the King of that city became very sad in his heart, because when so many chiefs and nobles were sitting there his daughter had chosen none of them, but had chosen that Fakir; but he kept these thoughts concealed in his heart. One day the traveller Prince said, \"Let all the King's sons-in-law come out with me to-day to hunt.\" People said, \"What is this Fakir that he should go a-hunting?\" However, they all set out for the hunt, and fixed their meeting-place at a certain pool. The newly married Prince went to his tigers, and told his tigers and hounds to kill and bring in a great number of gazelles and hog-deer and markhor. Instantly they killed and brought in a great number. Then taking with him these spoils of the chase, the Prince came to the pool settled on as a meeting-place. The other Princes, sons-in-law of the King of that city, also assembled there; but they had brought in no game, and the new Prince had brought a great deal. Thence they returned home to the town, and went to the King their father-in-law, to present their game. Now that King had no son. Then the new Prince told him that in fact he, too, was a Prince. At this the King, his father-in-law, was greatly delighted and took him by the hand and embraced him. He seated him by himself, saying, \"O Prince, I return thanks that you have come here and become my son-in-law; I am very happy at this, and I make over my kingdom to you.\"",
