He bathed himself and his horse in the tank, and then sat down under a tree. \"Now,\" he said to himself, \"I will eat some of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I will drink some water, and then I will continue my journey.\" He opened his handkerchief, and took out a sweetmeat. He found an ant in it. He took out another. There was an ant in that one too. So he laid the two sweetmeats on the ground, and he took out another, and another, and another, until he had taken them all out; but in each he found an ant. \"Never mind,\" he said, \"I won't eat the sweetmeats; the ants shall eat them.\"",
