They enjoyed the great feast that had been prepared for them, without a thought of saving any of it to take home to their mother—but the gentle Moon did not forget her. Of every dainty dish that was brought round, she placed a small portion under one of her beautiful long finger-nails, that Star might also have a share in the treat. On their return, their mother, who had kept watch for them all night long with her little bright eye, said, \"Well, children, what have you brought home for me?\"",
