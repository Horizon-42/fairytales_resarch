That is why I have not yet paid my respects to you; pray forgive me.\" And he laid the milk down and went to his house. Next morning he came and looked, and he saw a gold denar in the bowl, and from that time onward every day the same thing occurred: he gave milk to the serpent and found a gold denar. One day the Brahman had to go to the village, and so he ordered his son to take the milk to the ant-hill. The son brought the milk, put it down, and went back home. Next day he went again and found a denar, so he thought to himself: \"This ant-hill is surely full of golden denars; I'll kill the serpent, and take them all for myself.\"",

From this time forward friendship between us is impossible. Your son struck me in youthful ignorance, and I have bitten him to death. How can I forget the blow with the cudgel? And how can you forget the pain and grief at the loss of your son?\" So speaking, it gave the Brahman a costly pearl and disappeared.
