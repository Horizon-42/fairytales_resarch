The watchmen in the field dared not go up to him; but going home, they published the news. Then all the villagers came out with weapons in their hands; and blowing chanks, and beating drums, they went near the field and shouted. Terrified with the fear of death, the ass uttered a cry—the bray of an ass! And when he knew him then to be an ass, the future Buddha pronounced the First Verse: \"This is not a lion's roaring, Nor a tiger's, nor a panther's; Dressed in a lion's skin, 'Tis a wretched ass that roars!\" But when the villagers knew the creature to be an ass, they beat him till his bones broke; and, carrying off the lion's skin, went away. Then the hawker came; and seeing the ass fallen into so bad a plight, pronounced the Second Verse: \"Long might the ass, Clad in a lion's skin, Have fed on the barley green. But he brayed! And that moment he came to ruin.\" And even whilst he was yet speaking the ass died on the spot!",
