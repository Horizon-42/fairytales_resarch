    "text": "﻿In Ubayd Zakani’s satire, a cat dons the pose of a fasting ascetic. He preaches to mice about renouncing food and seeking virtue, convincing them to trust him.\nThe mice gather for his sermons; he singles out the devout and swallows them when they draw near. When fewer mice remain, he changes tactics, posing as a doctor to lure the sick.\nOne suspicious mouse stays back and warns the others. The cat’s hypocrisy is exposed when he cannot explain his bloody whiskers. The tale mocks false piety and gullibility, urging listeners to test sanctity before trusting power.",
