On the wedding night, Shirin and Talkhab slip away with a loyal servant. The lord wakes and pursues on horseback.
Shirin throws the pepper, raising a blinding sandstorm. She throws the spindle, which becomes a steep mountain ridge. She throws the water, which spreads into a wide river the pursuer cannot cross.
Cut off and stinging, the lord turns back. Shirin and Talkhab reach a neighboring village, where they marry freely with community support.
