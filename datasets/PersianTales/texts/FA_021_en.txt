At dawn they slip away. The witch wakes and barrels after them. The shepherd throws the needle; it becomes a thorn forest that snags the witch. He throws the salt; it rises into a jagged mountain. He throws the water; it swells into a river the witch cannot cross.
The witch howls and turns back. The shepherd brings the daughter home; she is freed from witchcraft. They marry with the village’s blessing, praising the helper’s foresight and the shepherd’s courage.
