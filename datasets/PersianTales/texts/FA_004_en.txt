Rostam defeats a dragon in the dark and resists the enchantress who tries to kill him. He also survives poisoned feasts meant to sap his strength. Each labor pairs his brute force with vigilance and faith.
In the final trials he overpowers the demon champions, including the White Demon. Rostam blinds the White Demon and uses its blood to restore the sight of Kay Kavus and his men. The seven labors prove his role as Iran’s protector.
