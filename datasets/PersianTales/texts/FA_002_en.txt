Prophecies say a child named Feraydun will end Zahhak’s reign. Kaveh joins the child’s hidden supporters and helps arm the rebels. The movement spreads through towns hungry for justice.
Zahhak marches to crush the uprising, but the rebels seize strongholds and free captives. Feraydun strikes Zahhak down and binds him in Mount Damavand rather than killing him outright.
With the tyrant chained, Kaveh’s apron becomes a royal standard. Justice and popular solidarity replace terror; the story frames rebellion as righteous duty.
