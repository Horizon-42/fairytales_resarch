Taleb and Zohreh elope at night on horseback, carrying the three objects.
Her brothers ride after them with drawn swords. Taleb throws the needle; it becomes a thorn forest that slows them. He throws the salt; it turns into a sea they must detour around. He throws the flour; a heavy fog blinds the riders until they give up.
The couple reaches allied kin over the mountain pass. With their blessing, Taleb’s songs announce the marriage, and Zohreh’s former suitor is left behind.
