    "text": "﻿A poor cobbler is grabbed by a div and forced to stitch sacks in its cave. The div’s daughter—or an old woman captive there—pities him and whispers that the monster plans to eat him.\n\nShe hands him a needle, a bar of soap, and a lump of salt. “If it follows you, throw these,” she says. They slip away while the div sleeps.\n\nThe div wakes and charges after them. The cobbler throws the needle; it becomes a wall of thorns. He throws the soap; the hillside turns slick with suds. He throws the salt; a lake swells between them. The div, scratched, sliding, and blocked, gives up the chase.\n\nThe cobbler brings the helper back to town. People reward him for beating the monster, and in some tellings he marries the brave helper.",
