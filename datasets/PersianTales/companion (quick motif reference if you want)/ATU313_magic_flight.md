Text (public-domain style summary)
The heroine works as a servant for a witch. A talking animal helper warns her that the witch plans to kill her. The helper gives her three objects: a comb, a jar of salt water, and a twig. The heroine escapes at dawn. The witch pursues. The heroine throws the comb; it becomes a dense forest. The witch cuts through. She throws the salt water; it becomes a wide river. The witch drinks it down. She throws the twig; it becomes a high mountain. Exhausted, the witch cannot cross. The heroine reaches home safely.

Notes for annotation
