ATU 402 — Animal Bride (Persian reference)

Suggested text: Shahmaran (serpent bride)

Text (concise summary for annotation)
A young man, Jamasp (or Tahmasp), discovers an underground garden and meets Shahmaran, a wise serpent woman. He stays with her, marries her under the condition of secrecy, and lives happily for years. Longing for his family, he asks to return; she allows it but warns him never to reveal her. A drought strikes; the king is ill, and the vizier says only bathing in the blood of Shahmaran will cure him. Jamasp is captured and, under pressure, reveals Shahmaran’s location. Shahmaran is killed; her flesh or blood cures the king (or the vizier), while Jamasp may be spared or cursed. In some variants, Shahmaran forgives him; in others, she curses betrayal.

Notes for annotation
- Taboo/condition: secrecy of her existence and underground realm.
