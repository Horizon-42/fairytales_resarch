# Character Archetypes (角色原型)

## 1. The Hero (英雄)

The Hero is the axis on which a story revolves. They’re usually thrown into extraordinary circumstances beyond their control through which they need to fight for a singular objective. Along the way the hero’s strength will be tested in a number of ways—maybe physically, mentally, spiritually, and/or morally.

英雄是故事围绕的轴心。他们通常被抛入超出其控制的非凡境遇中，必须为了一个单一的目标而战。沿途，英雄的力量将受到多方面的考验——可能是在身体、精神、灵性及/或道德上。

These trials will reveal exceptional strengths that set them apart from other characters in the story. These might be things like supernatural powers or a momentous birthright, or it might be something simple that comes from their humanity—a remarkable sense of compassion, an iron determination and sense of self, great courage in the face of terrifying acts. They might be natural leaders, or have a heightened survival instinct. Heroes are not flawless (pro tip: they’d be quite boring if they were), but the strength they exhibit in times of hardship is what will make your reader believe in them and follow them right up until the end.

这些考验将揭示出他们与其他角色不同的非凡力量。这可能像超自然力量或重要的出身权利，也可能源自他们人性中简单的一面——非凡的同情心、钢铁般的决心和自我意识、面对恐怖行径时的巨大勇气。他们可能是天生的领袖，或者拥有高度敏锐的生存本能。英雄并非完美无缺（专家提示：如果他们完美无缺，故事会很无聊），但在艰难时刻展现出的力量，正是让读者信任并追随他们直到最后的原因。

One of the oldest universal story patterns in literature is called “The Hero’s Journey.” Also called the “Monomyth,” the hero’s journey follows the protagonist through an adventurous cycle of navigating an irrevocably changed world, passing through an initiation or coming-of-age, achieving a goal, and returning home to rebuild from a new beginning. Although your hero is the central axis of your story, they don’t carry it alone (even if sometimes they think they do). Along the way the hero will meet many of the character archetypes listed below—some as obstacles, and some as friends.

文学中最古老的普世故事模式之一被称为“英雄之旅”（The Hero’s Journey），也称为“单一神话”（Monomyth）。英雄之旅跟随主角经历一个冒险循环：在一个不可逆转地改变了的世界中航行，经历启蒙或成年礼，实现目标，最后回到家乡从新的起点重建。虽然英雄是故事的中轴，但他们并不是独自承担一切（即使有时他们认为是这样）。沿途，英雄会遇到下列许多角色原型——有些是障碍，有些是朋友。

Examples of heroes in literature are Wonder Woman, Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, and Sir Gawain from Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

文学中的英雄例子包括神奇女侠（Wonder Woman）、哈利·波特（Harry Potter）、卢克·天行者（Luke Skywalker），以及《高文爵士与绿骑士》中的高文爵士（Sir Gawain）。

## 2. The Shadow (阴影)

The Shadow is a dark reflection of the hero. They might show us weaknesses in the hero that they fight to keep hidden, or what the hero could become if they allowed those weaknesses to consume them. In many ways, we all have this “shadow personality” (psychoanalyst Carl Jung believed it was an integral part of the human psyche) but in literature the shadow will either be a person mirroring the hero’s darkest traits and their darkest potential, or a very distinctive facet of the hero—for example, if they change their personality completely while under the influence of drugs, manipulation, or some external force. Very often you’ll see these characters take on two separate names for their opposing polarities, such as Angel and Angelus on the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

阴影是英雄的黑暗镜像。他们可能向我们展示英雄努力隐藏的弱点，或者如果英雄任由这些弱点吞噬自己可能会变成的样子。在很多方面，我们都有这种“阴影人格”（心理分析学家卡尔·荣格认为这是人类心理不可或缺的一部分），但在文学中，阴影要么是一个反映英雄最黑暗特质和最黑暗潜能的人，要么是英雄非常独特的一个侧面——例如，如果他们在药物、操纵或某种外部力量的影响下完全改变了个性。通常你会看到这些角色为他们对立的两极取两个不同的名字，比如电视剧《吸血鬼猎人巴菲》中的 Angel 和 Angelus。

Other examples of shadow archetypes are Gollum in The Lord of the Rings and Mr. Hyde in The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

其他阴影原型的例子包括《指环王》中的咕噜（Gollum）和《化身博士》中的海德先生（Mr. Hyde）。

## 3. The Sidekick (助手/搭档)

Sidekicks have been popularized by the comic book medium, but the idea has existed for much longer. The sidekick’s main role is to offer the hero a way to stay grounded despite all the obstacles they’re facing. This might be through comic relief or through cautionary advice (or both). The sidekick lacks whatever fundamental value has put the hero on their path—perhaps they’re not as brave, or not as strong, or not the “chosen one”—and they don’t carry the weight of the world in the same way. What they can do is offer a light in the darkness when your hero begins to lose some integral piece of themselves. Your sidekick keeps the hero from getting too close to the edge.

助手这一角色随着漫画媒介的流行而普及，但这个概念存在已久。助手的主要作用是让英雄在面对重重障碍时保持脚踏实地。这可以通过喜剧调剂或提供警示建议（或两者兼有）来实现。助手缺乏让英雄踏上征途的某种核心价值——也许他们不够勇敢，不够强壮，或者是“被选中的人”——他们也不以同样的方式背负世界的重担。他们能做的是在英雄开始失去自我的一部分时，在黑暗中提供光亮。你的助手可以防止英雄走得太远而坠入深渊。

Very often sidekicks in literature serve as a foil character to the protagonist. This means that they work in juxtaposition to the hero to draw attention to certain aspects of their personality. A great example of this is Batman and Robin, where everything about Robin’s brightly colored costume, his chattiness, and his positive energy contrast the darkness of Batman’s character.

文学中的助手通常作为主角的衬托角色。这意味着他们与英雄并列，以引起人们对英雄性格某些方面的关注。一个很好的例子是蝙蝠侠和罗宾，罗宾鲜艳的服装、健谈和正能量与蝙蝠侠性格的黑暗形成了鲜明对比。

Other examples of sidekicks include Friday from Robinson Crusoe and Ron Weasley from Harry Potter.

其他助手的例子包括《鲁滨逊漂流记》中的“星期五”（Friday）和《哈利·波特》中的罗恩·韦斯莱（Ron Weasley）。

## 4. The Villain (反派)

The villain archetype is the big baddie of your story—the challenge to which all roads lead. This character has an objective that is in direct conflict with the hero’s, and in order for them to reach their goal, they need to make sure that the main character is unable to reach theirs. This might be through killing them, humiliating them, discrediting them, or otherwise forcing them into submission.

反派原型是你故事中的大坏蛋——所有道路最终通向的挑战。这个角色的目标与英雄的目标直接冲突，为了实现自己的目标，他们必须确保主角无法实现其目标。这可以通过杀死、羞辱、败坏名声或以其他方式迫使主角屈服来实现。

The villain always has a reason for doing the terrible things that they do, even if that reason is twisted beyond what we might understand in our own perceptions and values. The best villains in literature are ones who truly believe that they’re doing the right thing, but have allowed their vision of the “right thing” to become clouded with ambition, fear, or pain.

反派做坏事总是有理由的，即使这个理由在我们自己的认知和价值观中是扭曲且无法理解的。文学中最好的反派是那些真心相信自己在做正确之事的人，但他们对“正确之事”的看法被野心、恐惧或痛苦所蒙蔽。

Some iconic villains in literature are Valentine from The Mortal Instruments, Professor Moriarty from the “Sherlock Holmes” stories, and Shere Khan from The Jungle Book.

文学中一些标志性的反派包括《圣杯神器》中的瓦伦丁（Valentine）、《福尔摩斯》故事中的莫里亚蒂教授（Professor Moriarty）和《丛林之书》中的谢利·汗（Shere Khan）。

## 5. The Lover (爱人/情人)

In a story, the lover archetype really just wants everyone to get along. They’re usually a “good” character, in the sense of having a functioning moral compass, but they lack the courage, sense of injustice, and capacity for self-sacrifice that the hero has. Though guided by the needs of their heart, lovers tend to take the path of least resistance that brings the least amount of harm to themselves and those they care for. Many traditionally artistic characters will fall into this category.

在故事中，爱人原型真的只是希望每个人都能和睦相处。他们通常是“好”角色，意味着有正常的道德指南针，但缺乏英雄所具备的勇气、正义感和自我牺牲的能力。虽然受内心的需求指引，爱人倾向于选择阻力最小的路径，以给他们自己和在乎的人带来最小的伤害。许多传统的艺术型角色都属于这一类。

In some ways, the lover is a reflection of the trickster archetype, which we’ll look at further below. Both try to stay out of trouble and have a limited scope of what’s worth fighting for.

在某种程度上，爱人是后面会提到的捣蛋鬼原型的镜像。两者都试图避开麻烦，并且对于值得为之奋斗的事物范围有限。

Examples of great lover archetypes in stories are Dustfinger in Inkheart and Pippin from The Lord of the Rings.

故事中伟大的爱人原型的例子有《墨水心》中的脏手指（Dustfinger）和《指环王》中的皮聘（Pippin）。

## 6. The Mentor (导师)

One of the most essential figures in the hero’s journey, the mentor is older (sometimes), wiser (always), and has knowledge and experiences beyond that of the hero’s. They may also have supernatural powers or a particularly specialized skill set. The mentor serves to give the protagonist a little nudge (or a violent shove) forward onto their path, bringing out the potential of what that hero will become.

作为英雄之旅中最重要的人物之一，导师通常更年长（有时），更智慧（总是），并拥有超越英雄的知识和经验。他们也可能拥有超自然力量或特别专业的技能。导师的作用是给主角一点推动（或猛烈的一推），让他们踏上征途，激发英雄未来的潜能。

The mentor is also a great tool for exposition and immersing your reader into your story. As the mentor teaches the hero about their world, the threats they’ll be facing, the steps they can take to overcome those threats, and how to develop the skills necessary to do so, your readers will learn everything they need to know about your story world right alongside them.

导师也是进行背景说明和让读者沉浸在故事中的绝佳工具。当导师教导英雄关于他们的世界、将面临的威胁、克服威胁的步骤以及如何培养必要技能时，读者也会随之了解关于故事世界的一切必要信息。

The most recognizable mentor figure in modern literature is the wizard Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings. Other examples include Haymitch Abernath from The Hunger Games and Merlin from the tales of King Arthur.

现代文学中最容易辨认的导师形象是《指环王》中的巫师甘道夫（Gandalf）。其他例子包括《饥饿游戏》中的黑密曲（Haymitch Abernath）和亚瑟王传说中的梅林（Merlin）。

## 7. The Mother (母亲)

Made famous by the godmothers of classic fairy tales, the mother archetype represents a supportive, nurturing presence in the hero’s life. They won’t always be a literal mother (although they can be); they don’t even necessarily need to be female. The mother character is strong and wise, but they differ from the mentor figure in that they don’t give the hero the tools they need to move forward on their journey; rather, they give the hero a safe place to come home to, a place to heal.

由经典童话中的教母形象发扬光大，母亲原型代表了英雄生活中支持和养育的存在。她们不一定总是亲生母亲（虽然也可以是）；甚至不一定是女性。母亲角色坚强而智慧，但与导师不同的是，她们不给英雄前进所需的工具；相反，她们给英雄一个可以归来的安全港湾，一个疗伤的地方。

Depending on where the hero is on their journey, there may be more than one character filling this role. Aunt May from “Spider-man” and Nokomis from The Song of Hiawatha are examples of mother archetypes.

根据英雄在旅程中的位置，可能会有一个以上的角色充当这一角色。《蜘蛛侠》中的梅姨（Aunt May）和《海瓦萨之歌》中的诺科米斯（Nokomis）都是母亲原型的例子。

## 8. The Everyman (普通人)

The everyman character is a projection of the reader. They’re an utterly normal person thrown into remarkable circumstances, and they adapt to the situation in much the same way that any one of us would. They usually say what they’re thinking and call things out that don’t make sense, and their normality might make them an outsider in a world where very un-normal things are happening. This archetype functions to bring some perspective to the story and make the plot more relatable to us as readers.

普通人角色是读者的投射。他们是完全普通的人，被抛入非凡的境遇，并以我们任何人都可能采取的方式适应情况。他们通常会说出自己的想法，指出不合理之处，而在一个发生非常不寻常事件的世界里，他们的正常性可能会让他们成为局外人。这个原型的作用是为故事带来某种视角，使情节对作为读者的我们来说更具可感性。

The everyman might be an unwilling hero, or they might be a sidekick or other supporting character that acts as a link between the main character and the reader.

普通人可能是不情愿的英雄，或者他们可能是助手或其他配角，充当主角与读者之间的纽带。

Dr. John Watson from the “Sherlock Holmes” stories is an everyman—faced with a genius best friend and some equally genius villains, he brings a comforting averageness to their world. Other examples of the everyman archetype are Arthur Dent from The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and Simon Lewis from The Mortal Instruments.

《福尔摩斯》故事中的约翰·华生医生（Dr. John Watson）就是一个普通人——面对天才好友和同样天才的反派，他为他们的世界带来了一种令人安慰的平庸感。普通人原型的其他例子有《银河系漫游指南》中的亚瑟·登特（Arthur Dent）和《圣杯神器》中的西蒙·刘易斯（Simon Lewis）。

## 9. The Damsel (落难少女)

The iconic damsel-in-distress is one of the most recognizable literary tropes, but this character can take many forms of any age and any gender. Sometimes called the “innocent,” they represent naivety, inexperience, and trust. The damsel is similar to the everyman in that they see everything with new eyes; but unlike the everyman, the damsel never gives up the idea that there’s good in the world. They cling to their innocence even when the events around them threaten to strip it away. Unfortunately, this determined positivity can lead them into some difficult situations, often requiring the services of a hero to rescue them.

标志性的“落难少女”是最容易辨认的文学修辞之一，但这个角色可以呈现任何年龄和性别的多种形式。有时被称为“天真者”，他们代表幼稚、缺乏经验和信任。落难少女与普通人相似，都用新奇的眼光看一切；但与普通人不同，落难少女从不放弃世界存在美好这一信念。即使周围发生的事件威胁要剥夺他们的天真，他们也紧抓不放。不幸的是，这种坚定的积极性可能会让他们陷入困境，通常需要英雄来拯救。

In a story, this archetype reminds us that there is always hope and wonder to be found in the world. Examples of classic damsels in literature are Alice from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Tiny Tim from Dickens’ A Christmas Carol.

在故事中，这个原型提醒我们，世界上总能找到希望和奇迹。文学中经典落难少女的例子有《爱丽丝梦游仙境》中的爱丽丝（Alice）和狄更斯《圣诞颂歌》中的小蒂姆（Tiny Tim）。

## 10. The Trickster (捣蛋鬼)

Tricksters are perhaps our most enduring character archetype, even more so than heroes. Before storytellers were repeating tales of Beowulf and King Arthur, they were gathering around the fire listening to stories about Coyote, Raven, and the spider god Anansi. Tricksters are neither good nor evil, but use cunning and cleverness to further their own ends. They might help the hero or they might hinder them, depending on which best suits their own agenda at the time.

捣蛋鬼可能是我们最持久的角色原型，甚至比英雄更甚。在讲故事的人重复贝奥武夫和亚瑟王的故事之前，他们就围在火堆旁听关于土狼（Coyote）、乌鸦（Raven）和蜘蛛神阿南西（Anansi）的故事。捣蛋鬼既非善也非恶，而是利用狡猾和聪明来达到自己的目的。他们可能帮助英雄，也可能阻碍英雄，这取决于当时哪种做法最符合他们自己的议程。

The trickster has given rise to one of our most popular modern archetypes, the antihero. Antiheroes are usually tricksters who, rather begrudgingly, have become invested in something more than just their own survival. They then need to reassess their goals which launch them onto a new path to becoming a hero in their own right.

捣蛋鬼衍生出了我们最受欢迎的现代原型之一：反英雄。反英雄通常是那些相当不情愿地投入到不仅仅是自身生存之中的捣蛋鬼。然后他们需要重新评估目标，这让他们踏上成为真正英雄的新道路。

Examples of famous tricksters in literature include Puck from Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the Weasley twins from the Harry Potter series, and Loki from Norse mythology.

文学中著名的捣蛋鬼例子包括莎士比亚《仲夏夜之梦》中的帕克（Puck）、《哈利·波特》系列中的韦斯莱双胞胎，以及北欧神话中的洛基（Loki）。

## 11. The Guardian (守卫者)

The guardian archetype is someone who stands at a threshold, holding the hero back from continuing on their journey. Guardians are usually quite single-minded and fixated on their goal of keeping two worlds, people, or experiences separated. Sometimes this might be someone guarding a literal doorway, such as the Sphinx of Egyptian mythology; other times it might be a new stage of life, such as an admissions officer who stands between a student and their dream school.

守卫者原型是站在门槛上阻挡英雄继续旅程的人。守卫者通常非常一根筋，专注于将两个世界、两个人或两种经历隔离开来的目标。有时这可能是守卫真正门户的人，如埃及神话中的斯芬克斯；有时可能是人生的新阶段，如阻挡学生进入梦想学校的招生官。

Guardians challenge the hero to reassess their situation and look at things in a new way. If the hero continues using the same strengths, tools, or techniques as they always have, they won’t make it past the threshold. They’ll need to try something different, probably something less comfortable, and exercise a new skill in order to continue towards their goal. By the time they make their way across the obstacle, they will have grown as a result of stretching the limits of who they can be.

守卫者挑战英雄去重新评估处境并以新方式看待事物。如果英雄继续使用一贯的力量、工具或技巧，他们将无法通过门槛。为了继续迈向目标，他们需要尝试不同的东西，可能是不太舒适的东西，并运用新技能。当他们克服障碍时，他们会因拓展自我极限而成长。

Examples of guardians in literature are the Wall guards from Neil Gaiman’s Stardust, the gatekeeper to the Emerald City in The Wizard of Oz, and the three-headed dog Fluffy from the Harry Potter series.

文学中守卫者的例子有尼尔·盖曼《星尘》中的城墙守卫、《绿野仙踪》中翡翠城的看门人，以及《哈利·波特》系列中的三头犬路威（Fluffy）。

## 12. The Herald (传令官)

The herald is a character that foretells a great change, usually near the beginning of the story. After they’ve made their appearance, nothing will be the same for the hero again. An example of a herald can be found in the classic fairy tale Cinderella, where a messenger shows up to announce that the king is seeking a match for his son, launching the plot into action.

传令官通常是在故事开始时预示巨大变化的角色。在他们出现后，英雄的一切都将不再相同。传令官的一个例子可以在经典童话《灰姑娘》中找到，信使出现宣布国王正在为儿子寻找配偶，从而启动了情节。

Although the herald’s job is to set the events of the plot in motion, they may also hang around to fill another role in the story later on. In The Hobbit, for instance, Gandalf begins as the herald by marking Bilbo’s door, and then shifts into a mentor figure once the story is on its feet. Other examples of heralds in literature are Effie Trinket in The Hunger Games and the three witches in Macbeth.

虽然传令官的工作是启动情节事件，但他们也可能留下来在故事后期充当其他角色。例如在《霍比特人》中，甘道夫一开始作为传令官在比尔博的门上做标记，一旦故事展开，他就转变为导师形象。文学中其他传令官的例子有《饥饿游戏》中的艾菲·特琳奇（Effie Trinket）和《麦克白》中的三个女巫。

## 13. The Scapegoat (替罪羊)

In literature, the scapegoat archetype is someone who takes the blame for another’s misdeeds. This often works a bit like a reverse guardian—their defeat clears the way for the villain to move forward towards their goal. Using a scapegoat allows your characters to unite against a common perceived enemy, thereby (temporarily) dispersing whatever tensions had been brewing. This is a useful literary device for turning the plot in a new direction.

在文学中，替罪羊原型是为他人的错误承担责任的人。这通常有点像反向的守卫者——他们的失败为反派实现目标扫清了道路。使用替罪羊可以让你的角色团结起来对抗共同感知的敌人，从而（暂时）消散正在酝酿的紧张局势。这是将情节转向新方向的有用文学手段。

Daphne Du Maurier’s The Scapegoat explores this idea in depth, looking at how someone might handle being burdened with another’s malefactions. Scapegoats in literature include Snowball from Animal Farm and Wilmer from The Maltese Falcon.

达芙妮·杜穆里埃的《替罪羊》深入探讨了这一理念，观察一个人如何处理背负他人罪行的情况。文学中的替罪羊包括《动物庄园》中的雪球（Snowball）和《马耳他之鹰》中的威尔默（Wilmer）。

## 14. The Outlaw (法外之徒)

The outlaw’s key strengths are their independence and the sense of self that keeps them from bending to societal constraints. This doesn’t always make them a lot of friends, but the ones they have are loyal and share the same ideas about what matters in life. The outlaw is often romanticized and well-liked, but other characters may grow to resent them through their envy of the outlaw’s lifestyle and freedom from expectations.

法外之徒的关键优势是他们的独立性和让他们不屈服于社会约束的自我意识。这并不总能让他们交到很多朋友，但他们拥有的朋友都很忠诚，并且在生活重要事项上持有相同观点。法外之徒通常被浪漫化并受人喜爱，但其他角色可能会因为嫉妒法外之徒的生活方式和不受期望束缚的自由而产生怨恨。

The outlaw is a major archetype in both The Adventures of Robin Hood and the original Spiderman comics, where the outlaw’s antagonists—the Sheriff of Nottingham and the newspaper man J. Jonah Jameson—express their hidden envy of a life that they could never have. Sometimes this animosity will put the outlaw onto a new path, turning them into a hero as their self-contained existence begins crumbling down.

法外之徒是《罗宾汉历险记》和原版《蜘蛛侠》漫画中的主要原型，其中法外之徒的对手——诺丁汉郡长和报社老板 J. Jonah Jameson——表达了他们对永远无法拥有的生活的隐秘嫉妒。有时这种敌意会将法外之徒推向新道路，随着他们自给自足的存在开始崩溃，他们变成了英雄。

Other outlaws in literature are Roux from Chocolat by Joanne Harris, and Maurice Leblanc’s character Arsène Lupin from the series of the same name.

文学中其他法外之徒有乔安妮·哈里斯《巧克力》中的鲁（Roux），以及莫里斯·勒布朗同名系列中的角色亚森·罗平（Arsène Lupin）。

## 15. The Rebel (反叛者)

Also called the revolutionary, the rebel archetype epitomizes “chaotic good”; they have a cause and they’re not afraid to burn a few bridges, or cities, in its name. The rebel sees something deeply wrong in their society and takes it upon themselves to change it, because nobody else is going to. The rebel archetype is deeply protective of the ones they love but tend to alienate all but the most devoted due to their inflammatory ideas.

反叛者原型也被称为革命者，是“混乱善良”的缩影；他们有一个事业，并且不害怕为了这个事业烧毁几座桥梁或城市。反叛者看到社会中存在严重的错误，并主动承担起改变它的责任，因为没有其他人会这么做。反叛者原型对他们所爱的人有极强的保护欲，但由于他们煽动性的想法，往往会疏远除了最忠诚者以外的所有人。

The rebel is a natural leader, and their passion for their cause makes people want to follow them. This passion is boundless and transcends minor annoyances like common sense, which means that this archetype can be a hero, a villain, or an antihero that falls somewhere in the middle. Examples of rebels in literature include Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games, Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird, and Lyra Belacqua from His Dark Materials.

反叛者是天生的领袖，他们对事业的热情让人们愿意追随。这种热情是无限的，超越了常识等微小的烦恼，这意味着这个原型可以是英雄、反派，或者是介于两者之间的反英雄。文学中反叛者的例子包括《饥饿游戏》中的凯特尼斯·伊夫狄恩（Katniss Everdeen）、《杀死一只知更鸟》中的阿提克斯·芬奇（Atticus Finch）和《黑暗物质》中的莱拉·贝拉夸（Lyra Belacqua）。

## 16. The Ruler (统治者)

The ruler is a natural leader in a position of power, such as a monarchy, a government office, or the head of a powerful company. Unlike the leadership skills displayed by the rebel, the ruler archetype thrives on order, stability, and tradition. They thrive in the status quo. They can be a force for good or for ill, but they will usually be put at odds with the hero for one simple reason: the ruler likes the way things are and doesn’t want them to change.

统治者是处于权力位置的天生领袖，如君主制、政府部门或强大公司的负责人。与反叛者展示的领导技能不同，统治者原型在秩序、稳定和传统中茁壮成长。他们在现状中如鱼得水。他们可以是向善的力量，也可以是作恶的力量，但通常会因为一个简单的原因而与英雄对立：统治者喜欢事物的现状，不希望它们改变。

While every one of us has the capacity to lead in times of conflict, not everyone handles being in a position of authority very well. Power corrupts, and even good people can find their values tested if they’re given too much power too quickly. This is why many ruler archetypes find themselves embroiled in conflict with those around them.

虽然我们在冲突时期都有领导的能力，但并不是每个人都能很好地处理处于权威地位的情况。权力导致腐败，如果被赋予过多权力且速度过快，即使是好人也会发现自己的价值观受到考验。这就是为什么许多统治者原型发现自己卷入了与周围人的冲突中。

Some ruler archetypes in literature are King Uther from the Arthurian legends and Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada.

文学中一些统治者原型有亚瑟王传说中的尤瑟王（King Uther）和《穿普拉达的女王》中的米兰达·普瑞斯特利（Miranda Priestly）。
