{In a kingdom steeped in ancient traditions, a just and revered King, burdened by the sorrow of being childless, sought solace in his royal gardens. One day, a gaunt Fakir, eyes gleaming with an otherworldly light, appeared at the palace gates. He offered a boon: two sons would grace the royal household, but in return, after seven years had passed, the King must surrender one of them to the Fakir. Desperate for an heir, and blinded by the promise of progeny, the King, despite a pang of unease, made the fateful pact.}
{Seven joyful years later, two strapping young princes, radiant with health and royal grace, played within the palace walls. When the time came for the Fakir to claim his due, the King, his heart aching with paternal love, devised a cunning deception. He dressed two slave children, carefully chosen for their similar age, in princely robes, and presented them to the Fakir in a secluded courtyard, hoping to fulfill his bargain without losing a son of his own blood.}
{The Fakir, with an inscrutable smile, sat cross-legged beneath a sprawling banyan tree, seemingly accepting the King’s offering. Yet, his gaze fell upon a bustling line of ants marching diligently across the stone path. Through his ascetic meditations and keen spiritual perception, he understood their tiny murmurs and whispered conversations. The ants, oblivious to the drama unfolding above them, chattered about the true King's Son and his younger brother, who were at that very moment laughing and playing with golden balls in the inner royal gardens, far from the courtyard.}
{Enraged by the King's treacherous attempt to deceive him, the Fakir rose, his serene facade shattering into a mask of fury. He strode directly to the royal gardens, ignoring the terrified protests of the guards, and seized the eldest Prince, a boy of seven years, by the arm. Before anyone could truly react, the Fakir, with a burst of dark energy, vanished into the swirling dust beyond the palace walls, taking the terrified King's Son with him to his desolate lair.}
{The Fakir led the captive Prince through rugged terrain to his secluded hermitage, a place of grim shadows and unholy rites. There, a great cauldron bubbled ominously over a roaring fire, filled with dark, viscous oil. With a malevolent grin, the Fakir seized the young Prince, intending to cast him into the scalding depths as part of a ritual to gain immense power, his cruel grip tightening on the boy's slender arm as he lifted him towards the bubbling, fuming pot.}
{Just as the Fakir was about to hurl him into the infernal brew, the young Prince, fueled by a surge of desperate strength and a flicker of divine courage, twisted violently. His small feet caught the Fakir's robes, sending the malevolent ascetic stumbling. With a shriek of surprise and pain, the Fakir toppled headfirst into his own boiling cauldron, dissolving into nothingness. The Prince then discovered a hidden chamber, where magnificent lions, majestic elephants, and swift eagles, all enchanted and imprisoned, awaited release. He freed them, and the grateful magical beasts bowed to him, pledging their eternal loyalty to their liberator.}
{Years passed, and the Prince, now a strapping young man known as the Traveller Prince, journeyed the land accompanied by his loyal retinue of magical beasts. One day, he encountered a powerful, formidable Bald Man, who ruled a stretch of the forest and challenged any who dared to cross his territory. A fierce battle ensued, but with the aid of his magnificent animals, the Traveller Prince eventually overpowered the Bald Man. Impressed by the Prince's prowess and the nobility of his spirit, the Bald Man surrendered, vowing lifelong fealty, becoming the Prince's devoted servant and the vigilant guardian of his magical companions.}
{The Traveller Prince eventually arrived in a prosperous kingdom where a beautiful Princess was preparing for her swayamvar, a ceremony where she would choose her husband. The Princess, swayed by the opulent displays of other suitors, or perhaps misjudging the Prince's modest appearance and his unconventional companions, initially overlooked him. She made a grave mistake in dismissing the quiet strength and inherent nobility of the Traveller Prince, believing him merely another common wanderer, a misjudgment that would soon be revealed through fate's intricate weave.}
{To prove their worth, the suitors were challenged to an arduous royal hunt for an elusive, mythical stag. One by one, the other princes, despite their grand entourages and skilled huntsmen, returned empty-handed, defeated by the forest's mysteries. But the Traveller Prince, with his loyal companions, excelled. His swift eagle soared, spotting the quarry from impossible heights; his mighty lion pursued it relentlessly; and his wise elephant, guided by ancient forest lore, led him to the magnificent beast, which he brought back as a testament to his extraordinary skill and fortune.}
{The King of that realm, deeply impressed by the Traveller Prince's unparalleled success and the unwavering loyalty of his unique companions, inquired about his origins. The Prince, seeing a paternal kindness in the monarch's eyes, recounted his entire harrowing tale: the Fakir's deal, his abduction, his miraculous escape, and his years of wandering. As he spoke, the King recognized a faint scar on the Prince's forehead – a birthmark he had seen only once. Overjoyed and overwhelmed, the King of that land, who was in truth his own Father, embraced his long-lost eldest son, declaring him the rightful heir and bestowing upon him the entire kingdom, along with the hand of the Princess.}
