{A shrewd hawker, named Govinda, who often travelled through the fertile Gangetic plains, owned a scrawny ass. Unable to afford fodder for his beast, Govinda devised a cunning plan. He found the discarded, moth-eaten skin of a magnificent lion, which he carefully draped over his docile ass, tying it securely to make it appear like a fearsome predator. Each evening, under the cloak of twilight, he would lead the disguised ass into the lush paddy fields bordering a prosperous village, whose watchmen usually guarded the ripening crops. The sight of what appeared to be a lion, stalking silently through the moonlit fields, sent shivers down the spines of the fearful villagers, who dared not approach, allowing the ass to graze freely and fatten itself on their precious harvest, night after night.}
{The villagers, however, grew increasingly desperate as their fields were continually plundered by the supposed beast. Their murmurs of discontent eventually reached the ears of the village elders and the head watchman, who convened a council under the great banyan tree. "We cannot let this lion devour our livelihood!" declared a brave farmer, his voice trembling with a mix of fear and resolve. Galvanized by their collective grievance, the villagers decided to take a stand. They armed themselves not with weapons, but with whatever would make the loudest clamour: drums, conch shells, metal plates, and their own booming voices, agreeing to march towards the fields at dawn, hoping to scare away the terrifying creature with an overwhelming din.}
{As the first rays of the sun painted the sky with hues of saffron and rose, the assembled villagers, numbering many, advanced cautiously towards the fields, their hearts pounding in their chests. Suddenly, a cacophony erupted – the booming of drums, the wailing of conch shells, the clanging of metal, and a thousand human shouts pierced the morning stillness. The disguised ass, startled by the unprecedented assault of sound, forgot its predatory role entirely. Overcome with instinctive terror and the familiar call of its own kind in such distress, it threw its head back and let out a series of loud, unmistakable "Hee-haw! Hee-haw!" brays, echoing across the fields, betraying its true, humble identity to the now stunned villagers.}
{A hush fell over the assembled crowd as the braying ceased, replaced by confused whispers. It was then that a venerable peasant, known throughout the region as the Wise Man, a Bodhisatta, stepped forward, his eyes twinkling with ancient wisdom. He had observed the strange "lion" for several nights from his humble abode and suspected a deception. "My dear friends," he announced calmly, his voice carrying authority, "Fear not! What you behold is no king of the jungle, but merely a common ass, cloaked in the skin of a lion. Its bray has revealed its true self, for a lion's roar is mighty and fearsome, not a humble donkey's call." The villagers, initially bewildered, now exchanged knowing glances, the truth dawning upon them.}
{A wave of indignation swept through the villagers, replacing their fear with righteous anger. They felt foolish and enraged at having been so easily deceived. Shouts of "Deceiver! Impostor!" rose from the crowd. Forgetting their earlier terror, they surged forward, grabbing their stout bamboo staffs and rusty hoes. They fell upon the braying ass with a fury born of wounded pride and plundered crops. Each blow was meant to avenge their stolen harvest and their humiliation. After a severe beating, they angrily ripped the tattered lion skin from the ass's trembling body, exposing the poor creature in its pathetic, true form, a stark symbol of its failed masquerade.}
{The wretched ass, battered and broken from the merciless beating, lay lifeless in the ravaged field, its brief stint as a king of beasts tragically concluded. The hawker, Govinda, who had been hiding nearby, observing the unfolding disaster, now emerged, his face a mask of sorrow and regret. He knelt beside his deceased animal, his shoulders drooping. "Alas, my poor ass," he lamented, shaking his head slowly, "If only you had remained silent, your disguise might have lasted forever. It was your own voice, your own true nature, that brought about your ruin." His words, a poignant commentary on pretension and self-betrayal, lingered in the quiet air as the sun continued its ascent, casting long shadows over the scene of the lesson learned.}
