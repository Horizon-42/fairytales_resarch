{In a small village nestled by the foothills, lived a hardworking but perpetually struggling man known simply as The Farmer. His fields yielded barely enough to feed his family, while the village's infamous Money-lender, a stout and cruel man named Sethji, grew fatter and richer each day, his mansion a testament to his exorbitant interest rates. One sweltering afternoon, driven by desperation, The Farmer approached Sethji, bowing low. "Master," he pleaded, his voice thick with humility, "you possess the secret to immense wealth. Please, in your great generosity, share with this poor man how one might find such fortune." The Money-lender, sneering at the Farmer's ragged attire, chuckled cruelly. "Wealth, simpleton? It comes from seeking Ram, the ultimate giver! Now begone, lest you soil my doorstep with your poverty."}
{Though the Money-lender's words were dripping with sarcasm, The Farmer, ever earnest and pure of heart, took them as divine instruction. His mind, unburdened by cynicism, believed that Ram, the benevolent Lord, truly held the key to prosperity. He resolved then and there to leave his meager farm, his worried wife, and his crying children, to embark on a quest. "I must find Ram," he declared to himself, his spirit rekindled by a simple, misconstrued phrase, "for only He can reveal the true path to a life free from want." He gathered his meager possessions, a small pouch of parched grains, and a tattered blanket, and set off towards the distant mountains, believing that such a powerful deity would surely reside in a grand, secluded abode.}
{The Farmer journeyed for many weeks, his feet calloused, his body weary, yet his spirit undaunted. He traversed sun-baked plains and climbed rocky hills, asking every traveler for directions to the abode of Ram. Finally, deep within a serene forest, he came upon a small, ancient ashram where a kindly old hermit sat in deep meditation. The Farmer, seeing the hermit’s peaceful countenance, felt a reverence wash over him. Without a word, he began to help the hermit with his chores, fetching water from the river, sweeping the ashram floor, and tending to the small garden, never once asking for anything in return, simply offering his tireless service out of devotion and hope.}
{Pleased by the Farmer's selfless devotion and the unwavering purity of his intention, the old hermit eventually opened his eyes and smiled, a radiant light briefly illuminating his face. "My dear son," he boomed, his voice resonating with divine power, "I am Ram, and I have witnessed your true heart." From within the folds of his simple cloth, Ram produced a shimmering, pearlescent conch shell. "This divine conch, a gift from the celestial ocean, will grant your every sincere wish. Blow into it, and your desire shall be made manifest. Use it wisely, my son, and speak not of its magic to others, for such power in the wrong hands brings only sorrow." With that, Ram vanished as suddenly as he had appeared, leaving the Farmer clutching the miraculous shell.}
{Returning to his village, The Farmer, with the help of the conch, quickly transformed his fortunes. His fields now yielded bountiful harvests, his cattle multiplied, and his home was rebuilt, modest yet comfortable. The Money-lender, Sethji, observed this dramatic change with simmering envy and suspicion. He invited The Farmer to his mansion under the guise of celebrating his prosperity, plying him with rich foods and flattery. "My friend," Sethji purred, "you have indeed found remarkable luck! Share with me, what is the secret to this sudden abundance? Did you truly find Ram?" The naive Farmer, trusting Sethji's feigned camaraderie and forgetting Ram's warning, proudly recounted his journey and, with sparkling eyes, revealed the magic wishing conch. That very night, after The Farmer had fallen into a deep sleep, Sethji crept into his home and stole the precious shell, slipping away like a shadow.}
{The Money-lender, brimming with avarice, immediately tried to use the stolen conch. He blew into it, roaring wishes for mountains of gold and palaces of jewels, but to his utter frustration, the conch remained silent, its magic refusing to obey his greedy commands. Realizing the conch would only respond to its true owner, The Farmer, Sethji devised a wicked plan. He confronted The Farmer, sneering as he brandished the conch. "Fool! Your luck has run out! I have your conch. But since it will not obey me, you shall make the wishes. However, for every wish you make, whatever you gain or lose, I shall receive double." The Farmer, heartbroken but trapped, had no choice but to agree to this cruel bargain.}
{The Farmer’s heart sank, yet his mind raced, seeking a way to turn the Money-lender's greed against him. Days passed in somber reflection until, inspired by a flash of tragic brilliance, The Farmer made his decision. He faced Sethji, his voice steady despite the anguish in his soul. Taking a deep breath, he raised the conch to his lips and blew a mournful note. "My wish," he declared, his voice echoing in the stillness, "is to lose one of my eyes." A searing pain instantly shot through his left eye, and he clutched his face, his vision blurring, knowing the terrible price he had just paid to exact justice.}
{A grotesque shriek ripped through the air as the conch's magic exacted its double toll. The Money-lender, Sethji, fell to the ground, writhing in unimaginable agony as both his eyes were instantly seared blind. He clawed at his face, his world plunged into sudden, eternal darkness. Blinded and delirious with pain and rage, he stumbled backwards, flailing wildly. His outstretched hands found no purchase, and with a guttural cry, he toppled headlong into the deep, abandoned well behind his mansion, a dark abyss that had long symbolized the bottomless pit of his own insatiable greed. The splash was followed by an eerie silence, and thus, the Money-lender met his deserved, pitiful end, a direct consequence of his own insatiable desire for double everything.}
