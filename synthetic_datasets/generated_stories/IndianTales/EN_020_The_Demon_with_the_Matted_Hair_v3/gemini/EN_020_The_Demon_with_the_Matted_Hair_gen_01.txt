{In the ancient and venerable city of Benares, a son was born to King Brahmadatta, a child of such radiance that the royal astrologers, wise Brahmans with eyes full of prophecy, declared him a Bodhisatta, destined to become the Prince of the Five Weapons and a great warrior king, whose wisdom would surpass his might. The entire kingdom rejoiced, knowing that the heavens themselves had blessed their monarch with such a glorious heir, whose very presence promised an era of unparalleled prosperity and peace for King Brahmadatta and his people.}
{As the Young Sir matured, his intellect shone as brightly as his spirit. Sent to the far-famed teacher in the storied city of Taxila, the Prince of the Five Weapons dedicated himself to mastering every art, from scripture to statesmanship, and above all, the martial disciplines. Upon the completion of his rigorous education, the Teacher, with a solemn nod of approval, bestowed upon him the sacred five weapons: a gleaming sword, a formidable spear, a resilient shield, a powerful bow, and a quiver of venomous arrows, symbols of his prowess and his readiness to face any challenge the world might present.}
{Journeying through the verdant lands, the Prince of the Five Weapons approached a dense, foreboding forest known as the Black Forest, its trees gnarled and shadows deep. From nearby villages, anxious men emerged, their faces etched with fear and caution. "Young Sir," they implored, bowing low, "do not venture into that accursed wood! It is the domain of the Demon with the Matted Hair, a monstrous yakkha who preys upon all who dare to trespass, devouring man and beast alike. Turn back, for your life's sake!"}
{But the Prince of the Five Weapons, the Bodhisatta, possessed a spirit unyielding and a heart devoid of fear. His resolve was unshaken by the men's desperate pleas. He knew his path lay through challenge, and the thought of abandoning those who might suffer from the demon's reign was anathema to his noble self. With a determined stride, and a calm, unwavering gaze, he ignored their warnings, tightening his grip on his weapons, and stepped purposefully into the oppressive gloom of the Black Forest, ready to confront whatever evil lurked within.}
{Deep within the forest's heart, the Prince encountered the terrifying Demon with the Matted Hair. He of the Matted Hair stood a colossal figure, with eyes like burning coals and a tangled mass of hair that resembled a thorny bush, sharp and unkempt. Without hesitation, the Prince of the Five Weapons attacked, letting loose a poisoned arrow that, instead of piercing the demon, merely stuck fast in his thick, matted hair. He then hurled his spear, which likewise became entangled, followed by his sword, shield, and even his last arrow, all rendered useless, snared inextricably within the Demon's formidable, coarse locks.}
{Undeterred by the loss of his weapons, the brave Prince of the Five Weapons advanced, his courage burning bright. With a roar, he struck the Demon with his right fist, but it too became stuck in the demon's matted hair. He tried with his left fist, then his right foot, and finally his left foot, each appendage meeting the same fate, becoming hopelessly entangled in the Demon's monstrous mane. Now completely disarmed and utterly trapped, the Prince stood before the menacing Hair-ball, immobilized, yet his spirit remained unbroken, his gaze fixed fearlessly upon his colossal adversary.}
{As the Demon with the Matted Hair drew nearer, preparing to devour him, the Prince of the Five Weapons, despite being completely ensnared, spoke with an astonishing calmness. "O Hair-ball," he declared, his voice steady, "you believe you have me trapped, but you are mistaken. You may have captured my five weapons and my four limbs, but know this: within me, I carry a sixth weapon, an indestructible thunderbolt of wisdom and courage. Should you attempt to consume me, this weapon will erupt from within, tearing you asunder and utterly destroying your vile existence."}
{A flicker of genuine terror crossed the Demon with the Matted Hair's eyes. He had never encountered such a dauntless foe, one who spoke of a weapon even when completely helpless. The thought of an internal "thunderbolt" of unyielding spirit struck deeper fear into his heart than any physical blow. Trembling, the Demon released the Prince of the Five Weapons, who, now free, stood tall and radiant. The Prince then took the opportunity to preach the Dhamma to the bewildered Demon, teaching him about the futility of evil, the path of compassion, and the lasting peace found in abandoning greed and violence, thus turning the malevolent yakkha away from his destructive ways forever.}
