{In the ancient and venerable kingdom of Benares, Prince Brahma-datta, destined to become the Future Buddha, reigned with such unparalleled wisdom and compassion that his dominion flourished in profound peace. His judgments were so equitable, his governance so faultless, and his people so content that discord vanished from the land. The grand halls of justice, once bustling with petitioners and lawyers, gradually became silent and empty, their polished floors reflecting only the sunlight filtering through tall windows, for there remained no grievances to settle, no disputes to arbitrate, and no crimes to punish among the righteous populace.}
{Despite this visible harmony and the constant adoration of his subjects, a subtle disquiet began to stir within the heart of King Brahma-datta. He harbored a profound humility, a quiet fear that the universal praise he received might merely be flattery, blinding him to his own shortcomings. A true seeker of perfection, he yearned for genuine criticism, a sincere voice that would pinpoint his flaws and guide him toward greater virtue, convinced that only by acknowledging imperfection could one truly ascend.}
{Driven by this earnest desire, and finding no one within the palace or the city walls bold enough to offer even a hint of censure, the Future Buddha resolved to leave his royal abode. Discarding his regal attire for simple garments, he mounted his magnificent chariot, instructing his loyal charioteer to travel into the tranquil countryside and then into the remote forests, hoping that away from the immediate influence of his benevolent rule, he might at last encounter an honest individual unafraid to speak truth to power, a true fault-finder.}
{As the King of Benares ventured deeper into a secluded forest path, winding and narrow, his journey was abruptly halted. From the opposite direction, with a flourish of dust and the rhythmic thud of hooves, approached another grand chariot. Seated within was King Mallika of Kosala, a monarch known for his firm and unyielding rule. The path was too constricted for two chariots to pass abreast, and with both drivers pulling their reins, the magnificent vehicles came to an impasse, facing each other in the silent woods, neither willing to yield.}
{A tense silence settled as the two royal charioteers dismounted. The charioteer of Benares, a man of quiet dignity, addressed his counterpart, suggesting they resolve the deadlock by comparing the status of their masters. He inquired about the wealth, lineage, age, and military might of the King of Kosala. Methodically, the two men exchanged details about their kings' kingdoms, their ancestral lines, the extent of their armies, and even their physical age. To their mutual astonishment and growing frustration, in every measurable aspect of worldly power and standing, the two monarchs proved to be precisely equal.}
{Finding no material distinction, the charioteer of Kosala, a man of robust demeanor, decided to compare the moral standing of their kings. He proudly declared his King Mallika's definition of righteousness: "My master is one who returns wrath for wrath, insult for insult, blow for blow. He harms those who harm him, and he honours those who honour him. He is praised as a righteous king because he practices strict retributive justice, meeting like with like." He saw this fierce fairness as the pinnacle of kingly virtue, an assurance of order through balanced retribution.}
{With calm assurance, the charioteer of Benares responded, his voice clear and resonant amidst the forest's quiet. He elucidated King Brahma-datta's true and profound righteousness: "My master, the King of Benares, is one who meets wrath with patience, returns good for evil, and endures insult without retort. He overcomes the wicked with kindness, vanquishes the greedy with generosity, and triumphs over falsehood with truth. He is truly righteous because he seeks to transform hearts, not merely punish deeds, believing that only goodness can truly overcome evil." In this exposition, he subtly yet powerfully exposed the limited "virtues" of the other king as rooted in cycles of reaction, rather than genuine moral elevation.}
{A profound silence followed the Benares charioteer's words. King Mallika of Kosala, who had been listening intently from his chariot, felt the piercing truth in the description of Brahma-datta’s character. He recognized the immense superiority of such virtue, a wisdom far beyond his own rigid code of conduct. Humbled and enlightened by this unexpected lesson, King Mallika, without hesitation, ordered his charioteer to reverse and back his chariot out of the narrow path, yielding the way to the Future Buddha, King Brahma-datta, and thus acknowledging the victory of true, compassionate righteousness.}
