{In the ancient kingdom of Benares, Prince Brahma-datta, destined to be the Future Buddha, ruled with unparalleled wisdom and compassion. His reign was a golden age, marked by such profound justice and harmony that discord vanished from the land. Farmers tilled their fields in peace, merchants traded without fear of deceit, and families lived without quarrels. The royal courts, once bustling with petitioners seeking arbitration, now stood empty, their massive gates wide open but no litigant daring to step inside, for Brahma-datta's perfect governance had eradicated the very need for dispute.}
{Despite this outward perfection and the universal praise he received, a subtle unease gnawed at King Brahma-datta's heart. He pondered, "Is this peace born of genuine virtue, or merely the silent deference of subjects too fearful or flattered to speak ill of their king?" A profound humility stirred within him, a deep yearning to uncover any latent flaw in his own conduct. He felt a spiritual lack, a need for honest criticism, fearing that unexamined virtue was merely a shadow of true enlightenment.}
{Driven by this sincere desire to find someone brave enough to point out his shortcomings, the King decided to embark on a solitary journey. Discarding his royal robes for the simple attire of a common traveler, he instructed his charioteer to ready a plain chariot. With only his trusted aide, Prince Brahma-datta ventured forth from the palatial city, leaving the security of his capital to seek out the candid voice of criticism amongst the common folk and beyond, hoping to encounter truth in the quiet countryside.}
{As they traveled through a sun-dappled forest path, narrow and ancient, another chariot appeared from the opposite direction. It carried King Mallika of Kosala, a powerful monarch known for his firm hand, also out on a tour of his kingdom. The road, barely wide enough for one conveyance, brought the two chariots to a sudden, jarring halt, face to face. Neither could advance, nor could either easily retreat on the winding, overgrown track. An unspoken challenge hung in the humid air, demanding precedence.}
{Recognizing the impasse, the Charioteer of Benares and the Charioteer of Kosala both dismounted, each keen to assert their master's right of way. They began a formal comparison, listing the usual metrics of royal status: "My king is older!" claimed one. "Mine is of higher lineage!" retorted the other. They debated their kings' wealth, the size of their armies, the fame of their capitals, their mastery of the Vedas, and even their physical prowess. Yet, with every boast and counter-boast, they found that King Brahma-datta and King Mallika were remarkably equal in every material aspect, a deadlock of temporal power.}
{Frustrated by the stalemate, Kosala's Charioteer, a man of proud bearing, declared, "Since material measures fail, let us compare our kings' virtues! My King Mallika is truly righteous: he punishes the fierce with fierceness, meets anger with anger, overcomes the wicked with wickedness, and returns good for good. He is 'tit-for-tat' personified, never suffering an injustice to go unavenged, nor kindness to go unrewarded. Such is his unwavering righteousness, a pillar of his dominion!"}
{Benares' Charioteer, with a calm smile, then spoke of his own sovereign. "My King Brahma-datta, the Future Buddha, defines righteousness quite differently. He overcomes anger with gentleness, evil with goodness, stinginess with generosity, and falsehood with truth. He is patient with the impatient, kind to the cruel, and forgiving of those who err. He truly leads by the power of compassion, never returning scorn for scorn, but always returning good for evil." He then subtly exposed the superficiality of Kosala's 'virtues,' implying that a king who meets evil with evil is merely echoing it.}
{Upon hearing the profound words defining the Future Buddha's boundless compassion and restorative justice, King Mallika of Kosala was deeply moved. The comparison illuminated the stark difference between true virtue and mere retributive strength. Humbled by the superior wisdom revealed, a wisdom that transformed his own 'tit-for-tat' into a lesser standard, King Mallika immediately ordered his Charioteer to back the chariot up, yielding the narrow path. He knew, without doubt, that the road belonged to the one whose virtue shone brighter, offering a silent tribute to King Brahma-datta's unparalleled goodness.}
