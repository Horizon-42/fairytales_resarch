{In the opulent palace of the Raja, a shadow of cruelty fell upon the seven princesses, whose deceased mother's memory had long faded from their father's mind. The Ranee, the Raja's new wife and the Prudhan's Widow, harbored a bitter jealousy towards their beauty and grace. She subjected them to unspeakable hardships, denying them food and proper clothing, leaving them to languish in hunger and despair within their chambers, the youngest, Balna, often comforting her older sisters.}
{Yet, even in their deepest suffering, a flicker of divine love pierced through. The spirit of their dead mother, sensing their plight from the heavens, manifested aid. First, a miraculous tree laden with sweetmeats and nourishing fruits sprang forth in their secret courtyard, providing sustenance. Later, when the Ranee's suspicions grew, a tank of rich, creamy milk appeared, sustaining the sisters and strengthening their resolve against the cruel stepmother's malice.}
{The Ranee's wickedness knew no bounds; discovering the princesses' continued survival, she falsely accused them of sorcery and demanded their blood from the Raja, claiming it was the only cure for her fabricated illness. The Raja, caught between his beloved new wife's demands and his daughters' lives, was distraught. With a heavy heart, believing he was sparing them a more brutal end, he ordered his faithful servants to abandon the seven princesses deep within the densest part of the jungle, leaving them to the mercy of the wild beasts.}
{Wandering lost and forlorn through the ancient, whispering jungle, the seven princesses, their royal garments torn, stumbled upon a secluded glade where seven noble princes were hunting. Drawn by their ethereal beauty and sorrowful plight, the princes, sons of a neighboring kingdom, took pity on them. Within a week, after tales of their abandonment were shared and their virtue recognized, a grand wedding was held, and each princess was wed to a prince, bringing joy and security back into their lives, with Balna, the youngest, marrying the youngest prince.}
{Their newfound happiness, however, was tragically short-lived. One fateful morning, the Seven Princes rode out for a grand hunt in the deep forest, promising to return by dusk. But the sun set, and rose again, and still, there was no sign of them. Weeks turned into months, and the princesses’ hearts were heavy with dread, for their husbands had been cunningly lured and captured by the malevolent Fakir, Punchkin, who sought to entrap anyone venturing near his domain.}
{It was then that Punchkin, the sinister Fakir, revealed himself, a gaunt figure with piercing eyes and a cruel smile. He appeared before the desolate princesses, seeking to claim one as his own. He singled out Balna, the youngest and most beautiful, demanding she become his wife. When Balna, still grieving her lost husband and filled with defiant courage, staunchly refused his wicked proposal, Punchkin, enraged, used his dark magic to snatch her away, spiriting her off to his hidden fortress, leaving her six sisters to weep in despair.}
{Years passed in sorrow and uncertainty. Within Punchkin’s oppressive fortress, Balna, though a prisoner, bore a valiant son, who grew up knowing only his mother's sorrowful tales of his lost father and uncles, and the villainy of Punchkin. As Balna's Son blossomed into a strong, courageous young man, the yearning for freedom and justice burned fiercely within him. One day, he vowed to his mother, "I will find them, Mother, and reclaim our family!" and bravely departed on a perilous quest to rescue them and liberate himself from Punchkin's shadow.}
{Balna's Son, now known simply as The Prince on his quest, journeyed until he reached the formidable outer walls of Punchkin's domain. There, he met Malee's Wife, the wise and kind gardener's wife, tending her patch of fragrant jasmine. Recognizing the noble spirit in his eyes, and having heard whispers of the Fakir's cruelties, she took pity on him. She gave him coarse garments and stained his skin with earth, disguising him as a humble gardener’s assistant, enabling him to gain entry into the heavily guarded palace grounds.}
{Under the guise of a lowly gardener, Balna's Son stealthily made his way deeper into the palace, his heart pounding when he finally came before his captive mother, Balna. He identified himself through a secret song from her youth and a small, heirloom locket she had given him as a babe. Overwhelmed with a mother's joy and a warrior's hope, Balna embraced her son, her tears flowing freely. She quickly agreed to his audacious plan: to feign affection for Punchkin and trick him into revealing the secret to his immortality.}
{With unwavering courage, Balna executed her part of the plan flawlessly. She began to treat Punchkin with a newfound, deceptive tenderness, showering him with false smiles and feigned admiration. Day after day, she would sweetly coax him, "My lord, tell me, where does your great power truly lie? What keeps you safe from all harm?" Swollen with pride and convinced of her affections, the arrogant Fakir finally succumbed to her charm, boasting that his soul was hidden far away, locked within a tiny green parrot, itself encased in seven concentric cages, deep within a jungle across the black waters.}
{Overhearing this crucial secret from his hiding place, Balna's Son knew his path. He departed Punchkin's palace and embarked on the perilous journey. As he traveled, he encountered a giant, venomous serpent slithering towards a nest of young eaglets, poised to devour them. With quick thinking and valor, Balna's Son slew the serpent, saving the helpless birds. From the heavens, the grateful parent Eagles descended, recognizing his noble deed, and offered to carry him swiftly on their powerful wings across the vast, black waters to the distant jungle where Punchkin's soul-parrot resided.}
{Guided by the mighty Eagles, Balna's Son located the ancient tree and within its hollow, the seven cages containing the emerald parrot. He returned to Punchkin’s palace, the parrot clutched in his hand. Confronting the terrified Fakir, Balna's Son squeezed the parrot's leg, and Punchkin shrieked in agony, forced to restore the Seven Princes, his uncles, and other victims from his dark spells. With his family freed and the balance of justice restored, Balna's Son crushed the small green parrot in his hand. At that instant, Punchkin, the malevolent Fakir, let out a final, guttural cry and collapsed, lifeless, his tyrannical reign brought to an abrupt and righteous end.}
