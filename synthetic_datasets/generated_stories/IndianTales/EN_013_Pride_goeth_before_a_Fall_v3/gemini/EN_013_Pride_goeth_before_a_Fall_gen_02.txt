{On a sun-baked road winding through arid plains, a caravan of eleven cloth merchants, heavy with the profits of a bustling market, journeyed homeward. Among them was the Clever Merchant, their respected Leader, whose quick wit was as renowned as his exquisite silks. As the afternoon sun beat down relentlessly, a fearsome cry split the air. From behind a thicket of thorny scrub, three burly figures emerged, the notorious robbers who styled themselves the "Three Monarchs" of the highway. With menacing clubs and glinting daggers, they ambushed the unsuspecting traders, swiftly disarming them, stripping them of their rich turbans, fine kurtas, and even their humble dhotis, leaving them bare and vulnerable on the dusty ground beside their plundered wares.}
{Drunk on their sudden victory and the heaps of precious cloth and coin, the Three Robbers began to celebrate, their crude laughter echoing across the barren landscape. Their leader, a corpulent man with a scarred face, leered at the shivering merchants. "Ha! What a pitiful sight!" he bellowed. "But even plucked pigeons can dance, can they not? Amuse us, you wretched traders! Dance for your masters!" And so, with taunts and prods, the robbers forced the humiliated merchants to perform a grotesque dance, their bare feet shuffling awkwardly in the dust, their hearts heavy with despair and the sting of injustice.}
{As the merchants reluctantly capered, their Clever Merchant, the Leader, observed his captors closely. He noticed their arrogance, their distraction, and the slight weariness in their posture from their drunken revelry. A cunning plan sparked in his mind. With a deep breath, he began to sing, his voice carrying a melancholic tune that seemed to lament their plight, yet within its rhythm, he wove words understood only by his fellow Traders. "Erith, enty, eno, the wind it blows so low," he crooned, his eyes subtly flicking towards the nearest robber. "Erith, enty, eno, a grip upon the foe! When the second 'eno' rings, each man to battle springs!" The Ten Cloth Merchants, knowing their Leader's ways, recognized the ancient guild jargon, their eyes widening with a glimmer of desperate hope.}
{As the Clever Merchant’s song reached its carefully timed climax, his voice rising with a final, piercing "eno!", the Ten Cloth Merchants, despite their earlier despair and humiliation, sprang into action with a coordinated ferocity born of desperation. Like a sudden gust of wind, they moved as one, their naked bodies surprisingly agile. One merchant tripped a robber with his foot, another seized a discarded club, and a third, with a surge of strength, tackled a villain, causing him to drop his dagger. In a whirlwind of swift, desperate movements, they overpowered the surprised robbers, using their own stolen dhotis and lengths of fine silk from their plundered bales to bind the struggling bandits securely, their pride now thoroughly humbled.}
{With the Three Robbers trussed like sacks of grain, their boasting silenced and their power shattered, the merchants quickly recovered their stolen clothing and their precious goods. The Clever Merchant, still composed, oversaw the gathering of every coin, every bolt of silk, and every turban. The journey home, which had begun in despair, now transformed into a triumphant procession. News of their cunning victory spread like wildfire, and the Clever Merchant and his Ten Cloth Merchants were hailed as heroes, their tale serving as a timeless reminder across the land that even the mightiest pride is destined for a fall.}
