{In the ancient kingdom of Varanasi, King Brahma-datta was renowned not only for his just rule but also for his incessant, tireless speech. His court often stretched late into the night, not due to complex affairs of state, but because the King would hold forth on every conceivable subject, leaving his ministers exhausted and pressing matters delayed. The King's Adviser, a revered sage known as The Future Buddha, observed this with quiet concern, recognizing that this garrulous habit, though seemingly harmless, was a significant impediment to true wisdom and efficient governance. He resolved to find a way to gently guide the King towards a more balanced demeanor.}
{Far away, by a drying lake in the lower Himalayas, lived two noble Hamsas, magnificent wild ducks with wings of gold, and their dear friend, a Tortoise, known affectionately as Friend Tortoise. As the hot season intensified and their home began to shrink, the two Hamsas decided to migrate to the mythical Golden Cave, a wondrous place high in the mountains where water was always plentiful. Seeing their friend's plight, they compassionately offered to carry Friend Tortoise with them, though he was bound to land and slow by nature, to the lush paradise.}
{The Hamsas, however, knew the journey would be perilous for their shelled companion. They devised a clever plan: Friend Tortoise would clamp firmly onto the middle of a strong stick with his mouth, and each Wild Duck would grasp an end, thus carrying him aloft. Yet, they set a strict and vital condition. "Friend Tortoise," one Hamsa warned with gravitas, "you must not, under any circumstances, utter a single word during our flight. If you open your mouth, you will fall and perish." The Tortoise, thrilled by the prospect of flight and new lands, readily agreed, solemnly promising to remain silent.}
{With the ingenious plan in place, the two majestic Wild Ducks took their positions, each holding an end of a sturdy wooden stick. Friend Tortoise, with unwavering determination and a firm grip, bit down hard upon the stick's center. With powerful beats of their wings, they gracefully lifted into the boundless sky, leaving the parched lake and familiar earth behind. The trio ascended higher and higher, the cool mountain air rushing past them as they soared northwards towards the distant, glistening peaks of the Himalayas, the Tortoise marveling at the world unfolding beneath him.}
{As they passed over a bustling village, the everyday activities of its inhabitants paused abruptly. A Villager, then another, looked up, pointing with awe and disbelief. "Look!" exclaimed one woman, her voice ringing with amazement, "Two wild ducks are carrying a tortoise in the sky! What an incredible, unbelievable sight!" Soon, a chorus of laughter and exclamations rose from the villagers, their excited comments and mock admiration drifting upwards, directly into the sensitive ears of Friend Tortoise, challenging his resolve.}
{The Tortoise, known for his pride and quick temper, could not endure the perceived ridicule and astonishment from the Villager. Forgetting the Hamsas’ solemn warning and his own sworn promise, he opened his mouth wide to retort, "What fools you are! What is so marvellous about—" But before the words could fully escape his lips, his grip on the stick vanished. He plummeted downwards from the immense height, a tragic speck against the vast blue, falling headlong towards the earth below, crashing lifelessly into the startled crowd.}
{News of the astonishing and tragic incident of the talkative tortoise quickly reached the royal palace. The Bodisat, the King's Adviser, recognized this as the perfect moment to deliver his long-considered lesson. He recounted the entire tale to King Brahma-datta with vivid detail, concluding, "Just as the foolish tortoise met his untimely end through his inability to control his tongue, so too, O King, can careless and excessive speech bring ruin. True wisdom, my Teacher always said, lies not in speaking much, but in speaking with purpose, and knowing when to maintain a noble silence."}
{King Brahma-datta listened intently, his usually effusive nature subdued by the Bodisat’s profound narrative. The vivid image of the plummeting tortoise, a stark consequence of unbridled speech, resonated deeply within his heart and mind. From that day forward, the King, reflecting upon the cautionary tale, made a conscious effort to rein in his garrulous habits. He transformed himself, becoming a sovereign known for his measured words and attentive listening, a truly wise ruler who spoke only when necessary, much to the quiet satisfaction of the Bodisat and the improved governance of his kingdom.}
