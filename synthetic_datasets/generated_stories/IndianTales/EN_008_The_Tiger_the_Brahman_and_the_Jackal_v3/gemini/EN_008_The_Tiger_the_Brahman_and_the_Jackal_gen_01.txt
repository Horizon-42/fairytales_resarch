{Deep within a dense jungle, where ancient trees loomed like silent sentinels, a fearsome Savage beast found himself ensnared. It was a magnificent Tiger, its striped hide rippling with frustrated power, but now utterly helpless within the cunning confines of a sturdy trap. For three days and nights, he had roared and struggled, his mighty jaws unable to bend the thick iron bars that held him captive, the pangs of hunger beginning to gnaw at his arrogant spirit.}
{As fate would have it, a pious Brahman, known for his gentle heart and adherence to Dharma, happened upon the trapped creature. The Tiger, seeing a chance, immediately adopted a pitiable guise, pleading with a honeyed voice, "Oh noble Mr. Brahman, have mercy! Release me from this wretched trap, and I swear by all that is sacred, I shall never harm you." Moved by what he perceived as genuine distress, and trusting in the inherent goodness he wished to see in all beings, the kind Mr. Brahman, with considerable effort, unfastened the trap's heavy door, setting the Savage beast free.}
{No sooner was he out than the Tiger’s true nature asserted itself. Its eyes, which had been full of feigned supplication, now gleamed with predatory hunger. "Foolish Mr. Brahman!" the Savage beast snarled, blocking the narrow path. "You are a meal sent by the heavens! Three days I have starved, and now I shall feast upon you, my rescuer!" The Mr. Brahman recoiled in horror, protesting the blatant treachery, but the Tiger merely licked its chops, unmoved by pleas of gratitude.}
{Desperate, the Mr. Brahman begged for justice, suggesting they consult a judge. The Tiger, confident in its might, agreed, and they first approached a venerable Pipal Tree, its roots deep in the soil of ages. The Pipal Tree, rustling its ancient leaves, spoke with a sigh, "Humans take my shade, pluck my leaves, and never once think to water my roots. They are ungrateful creatures, always taking. Why should this Savage beast be any different? He does what is in his nature."}
{Dismayed but not defeated, the Mr. Brahman then sought the wisdom of an old Buffalo grazing nearby, its hide worn smooth by years of toil. The Buffalo, chewing thoughtfully, replied, "For years, I gave milk, pulled the plow, and labored tirelessly for my master. When I grew old and could no longer work, he cast me out to fend for myself, leaving me to the mercy of predators. Such is humanity's cruelty. The Savage beast is merely following its instinct, as humans follow theirs."}
{With sinking heart, the Mr. Brahman made one last appeal to The Road itself, a witness to countless journeys and encounters. The Road, dusty and ancient, rumbled, "People walk all over me, day in and day out, with heavy loads and sharp hooves, never once thanking me for bearing their weight or guiding their way. They litter my edges and carve ruts into my surface. Gratitude, dear Mr. Brahman, is a word spoken but rarely acted upon in the world of humans. This Tiger’s actions are but a reflection."}
{As the distraught Mr. Brahman stood contemplating his grim fate, a small, quick-witted Jackal trotted past. Sensing the tension, and observing the triumphant Tiger and the despairing Mr. Brahman, the Jackal inquired with a tone of utter bewilderment, "What is this strange situation? A Mr. Brahman and a Savage beast debating by a trap? I simply cannot comprehend the state of affairs." Feigning complete ignorance, he insisted he must see the exact situation before offering any judgment, thus gaining time and subtly guiding them back to the original spot.}
{Reaching the trap, the Jackal peered at it with an exaggerated frown of confusion. "But how could such a large Savage beast fit into this small contraption?" he asked, scratching his head. "And how did the Mr. Brahman get you out? I am a very simple creature and cannot understand. Would you be so kind, oh mighty Tiger, as to show me precisely how you were caught? I cannot make sense of it otherwise." The Jackal’s persistent "stupidity" began to irritate the proud Savage beast, who longed to demonstrate his cleverness.}
{Finally, with a frustrated growl, the Tiger declared, "Very well, you witless creature! Observe closely!" With a powerful leap, the Savage beast squeezed himself back into the narrow confines of the trap, demonstrating how he had been confined. In that instant, as the Tiger stood once more behind the bars, the quick-thinking Jackal, with a triumphant grin, slammed the heavy door shut, locking the Savage beast firmly back inside. The Brahman, overcome with relief, offered heartfelt thanks to his wise rescuer, the Jackal, whose cunning had saved his life.}
