# Vladimir Propp's Morphology of the Folktale: A Structural Guide

**Source**: Vladimir Propp, *Morphology of the Folktale* (1928/1968).
**Core Concept**: Functions are stable, constant elements in a tale, independent of who performs them.
**Note**: Do not interpret functions literally; focus on their **structural role** in the narrative flow.

## Part 1: Detailed Structural Index

### Phase 1: The Preparatory Section
*Setting the stage for conflict.*

| Symbol | Function Name | Structural Meaning & Deep Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\alpha$** | **Initial Situation** | Introduction of family members and the hero. The state of equilibrium before the conflict. |
| **$\beta$** | **Absentation** | An authority figure leaves home (e.g., parents go to work). This creates a **vacuum of order/protection**. |
| **$\gamma$** | **Interdiction** | An interdiction is addressed to the hero (e.g., "Don't open that door"). This represents **boundary setting**. |
| **$\delta$** | **Violation** | The interdiction is violated. This is the **necessary condition** for misfortune. The villain often enters here. |
| **$\epsilon$** | **Reconnaissance** | The villain makes an attempt at reconnaissance (e.g., "Who lives here?"). Seeking the victim's weakness. |
| **$\zeta$** | **Delivery** | The villain receives information about the victim. A breach in the defense system. |
| **$\eta$** | **Trickery** | The villain attempts to deceive the victim (e.g., The Wolf in disguise). |
| **$\theta$** | **Complicity** | The victim submits to deception and unwittingly helps the enemy. **Total collapse of defense**. |

### Phase 2: The Complication
*The story properly begins; the Hero's mission is established.*

| Symbol | Function Name | Structural Meaning & Deep Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | **Villainy** | The villain causes actual harm (kidnapping, theft, murder). **Core Driver Type 1**. |
| **a** | **Lack** | (Mutually exclusive with A) No villainy, but a family member **lacks** something (desire for a child, magical object). **Core Driver Type 2**. |
| **B** | **Mediation** | Misfortune is made known; the hero is approached with a request or dispatched. |
| **C** | **Counteraction** | The seeker agrees to or decides upon counteraction. The Hero's **volition**. |
| **$\uparrow$** | **Departure** | The hero leaves home. Physical transfer of space; entry into the **adventure world**. |

### Phase 3: The Donor Sequence
*Acquiring the means (magic/helpers) to win.*

| Symbol | Function Name | Structural Meaning & Deep Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **D** | **1st Function of Donor**| **The Test**. The hero is not just given an item but is **tested** or interrogated by a potential donor. |
| **E** | **Hero's Reaction** | The hero reacts to the actions of the future donor (shares food, answers riddles, passes test). |
| **F** | **Receipt of Agent** | The hero acquires the use of a magical agent or helper (because E was successful). **Acquisition of Power**. |

### Phase 4: The Struggle
*Direct confrontation and resolution.*

| Symbol | Function Name | Structural Meaning & Deep Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **G** | **Guidance** | The hero is transferred or led to the whereabouts of the object of search (e.g., flying carpet, wolf guide). **Spatial Bridge**. |
| **H** | **Struggle** | The hero and the villain join in direct combat (battle, contest, card game). |
| **J** | **Branding** | The hero is branded (wounded or marked). Used later for Recognition (Q). |
| **I** | **Victory** | The villain is defeated (killed, driven away, or loses contest). |
| **K** | **Liquidation** | The initial misfortune (A) or lack (a) is liquidated. The object is found; the prisoner is freed. |

### Phase 5: The Return & Recognition
*The final test of status and the ultimate reward.*

| Symbol | Function Name | Structural Meaning & Deep Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$\downarrow$** | **Return** | The hero returns. |
| **Pr** | **Pursuit** | The hero is pursued (often where the "Obstacle Flight" pattern occurs). |
| **Rs** | **Rescue** | Rescue of the hero from pursuit (e.g., throwing a comb to create a forest). |
| **o** | **Unrecognized Arrival**| The hero, unrecognized, arrives home or in another country (often in disguise). |
| **L** | **Unfounded Claims** | A **False Hero** (e.g., brother, minister) presents unfounded claims to the hero's prize. |
| **M** | **Difficult Task** | A difficult task is proposed to the hero (e.g., lift heavy stone, drink boiling oil). |
| **N** | **Solution** | The task is resolved. |
| **Q** | **Recognition** | The hero is recognized (often via the Brand/Mark J). |
| **Ex** | **Exposure** | The false hero or villain is exposed. |
| **T** | **Transfiguration** | The hero is given a new appearance (new clothes, youth, divine status). **Substantive Elevation**. |
| **U** | **Punishment** | The villain or false hero is punished. |
| **W** | **Wedding** | **The Ultimate Reward**. Marriage, ascension to the throne, or apotheosis (becoming a god). **Reconstruction of Social Order**. |

## Part 3: Annotation Guidelines & Expert Tips

When training LLMs or annotating data, follow the **structural logic**, not the literal definition.

### 1. The "Donor Triangle" (D-E-F)
Do not annotate "F (Receipt of Agent)" in isolation. F almost always relies on a preceding test sequence.
* **Incorrect**: Hero finds a sword -> F.
* **Correct**: Hero meets old man (D) -> Hero shares water (E) -> Old man gives sword (F).
* **Application**: If a "meeting" results in acquiring an ally or item, the meeting itself is likely D (Test) or F (Receipt), not just a random event.

### 2. A vs. a (The Narrative Engine)
Every story typically has one core driver established at the beginning. Distinguish them:
* **Type A (Villainy)**: Driven by **Restoration** (getting back someone/something that was taken).
* **Type a (Lack)**: Driven by **Acquisition** (getting something the hero never had, e.g., the Water of Life).

### 3. W (Wedding) implies "Ultimate Reward"
Do not be limited by the word "Wedding." It represents the **Final Status Elevation**.
* **Scenario**: Ne Zha becomes a deity; A poor man becomes rich.
* **Annotation**: **W** (Wedding/Accession).
* **Reason**: The narrative function is the confirmation of a new, higher social or cosmic status.

### 4. Handling "Obstacle Flight"
This is a specific combination of **Pr (Pursuit)** and **Rs (Rescue)**.
* **Pr**: The villain chases the hero.
* **Rs**: The hero throws a comb that turns into a forest to block the path.

### 5. "Encounter" is not a Function
An "encounter" or "meeting" is not a function in itself; it is defined by its **outcome**.
* Encounter Villain -> **$\epsilon$** (Reconnaissance) or **H** (Struggle).
* Encounter Helper/Donor -> **D** (Test) or **F** (Receipt of Agent).
* Encounter Dispatcher (King/Father) -> **B** (Mediation).
