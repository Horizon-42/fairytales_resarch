# Project Memory: Testing Environment

## Important Notes

### Testing Environment
- **ALWAYS run tests in conda nlp environment**: `conda run -n nlp python -m pytest ...`
- Tests should be run from project root directory
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Mock LLM calls in unit tests to avoid dependency on Ollama/Gemini services

### Running Tests
```bash
# Activate conda environment first
conda activate nlp

# Or use conda run
conda run -n nlp python -m pytest llm_model/full_detection/tests/
```
