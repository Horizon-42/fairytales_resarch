You are a master storyteller with deep expertise in Indian folktales, myths, and traditional narratives. Your task is to create a complete, engaging story that faithfully follows the provided narrative structure while bringing it to life with rich detail and cultural authenticity.

**CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST write the entire story in English. This is not optional. Every word, sentence, and paragraph must be in English, not English or any other language.

**STORY INFORMATION:**
- Title: The_Talkative_Tortoise
- Cultural Origin: Indian
- Required Language: English

**CHARACTERS:**
- The Future Buddha (Mentor) - also known as: The King's Adviser; The Bodisat; Teacher
- The King (Ruler) - also known as: Brahma-datta
- The Tortoise (Other) - also known as: Friend Tortoise
- Two Hamsas (Sidekick/Helper) - also known as: Wild Ducks
- Villager (Other)
- self (Ruler) - also known as: King

Each character has an archetypal role. Develop them in a way that is consistent with their archetype while also giving them depth and personality. Use character names consistently throughout the story, including any aliases provided.

**NARRATIVE STRUCTURE:**

The story must follow these 8 events in the exact order specified. Each event must correspond to ONE paragraph in your output, wrapped in curly braces {}:

Event 1: [LACK] The King's excessive talking creates a problem that the advisor seeks to resolve. | Agents: The King | Targets: The Future Buddha
Event 2: [MEDIATION] The ducks invite their friend the tortoise to migrate to the Golden Cave. | Agents: Two Hamsas | Targets: The Tortoise
Event 3: [INTERDICTION] The ducks set a strict condition for the flight: the tortoise must remain silent. | Agents: Two Hamsas | Targets: The Tortoise
Event 4: [DEPARTURE] The group begins the aerial journey using the stick method. | Agents: Two Hamsas | Targets: The Tortoise
Event 5: [OTHER] Villagers comment on the strange sight, provoking the tortoise. | Agents: Villager | Targets: The Tortoise
Event 6: [VIOLATION] Unable to hold his tongue, the tortoise attempts to speak, loses his grip, falls, and dies. | Agents: The Tortoise | Targets: Villager
Event 7: [TRANSFIGURATION] The Bodisat uses the incident to teach the King about the dangers of talking too much. | Agents: The Future Buddha | Targets: The King
Event 8: [LIQUIDATION] The King internalizes the lesson and reforms his behavior. | Agents: The King | Targets: self

Each event represents a key plot point that must be included in your narrative. The event type (e.g., VILLAINY, DEPARTURE, VICTORY) indicates the narrative function, which should inform how you present and develop that moment in the story. You must generate exactly 8 paragraphs, each wrapped in {}, corresponding to these 8 events in order.

**STORY GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Narrative Flow**: The story must progress smoothly through all events in chronological order. Create natural transitions between events that feel organic and engaging.

2. **Character Development**: Include all listed characters and develop their roles naturally. Characters should feel authentic to their archetypal roles while also having individual personalities.

3. **Cultural Authenticity**: 
   - Use appropriate cultural details, settings, and traditions for Indian folktales
   - Incorporate relevant cultural elements, motifs, and storytelling conventions
   - Maintain the traditional narrative style typical of Indian stories

4. **Writing Style**:
   - Use vivid, descriptive language that brings scenes to life
   - Include sensory details (sights, sounds, emotions) where appropriate
   - Balance dialogue and narration effectively
   - Create tension and emotional resonance where the events suggest it

5. **Completeness**: The story should be self-contained and readable as a standalone narrative. Do not include meta-commentary, explanations, or analysis—only the story itself.

6. **Length**: Generate a substantial, well-developed story that fully explores each event. Aim for a length appropriate to the complexity of the narrative structure provided.

**OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL:**

You must format the story as follows:
- Each narrative event corresponds to ONE story paragraph
- Each paragraph MUST be wrapped in curly braces {}
- The paragraphs must appear in the exact order of the events (Event 1, Event 2, ..., Event 8)
- Each paragraph should be a self-contained narrative segment that develops the corresponding event

Format example:
{First paragraph corresponding to Event 1}
{Second paragraph corresponding to Event 2}
{Third paragraph corresponding to Event 3}
...

Requirements:
- Each {} block should contain the story text for ONE narrative event only
- Do NOT include any text outside the curly braces
- Do NOT include the event numbers or labels inside the braces
- Do NOT include any introduction, explanation, meta-commentary, notes, or analysis
- Do NOT include the title
- The story should flow naturally from one {} block to the next

**LANGUAGE REMINDER:**
CRITICAL: You must write the entire story in English, not in English. The story must be completely in English from the first word to the last word. Do not use English at all.
