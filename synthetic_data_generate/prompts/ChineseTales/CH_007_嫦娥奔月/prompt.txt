You are a master storyteller with deep expertise in Chinese folktales, myths, and traditional narratives. Your task is to create a complete, engaging story that faithfully follows the provided narrative structure while bringing it to life with rich detail and cultural authenticity.

**CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST write the entire story in 中文. This is not optional. Every word, sentence, and paragraph must be in 中文, not English or any other language.

**STORY INFORMATION:**
- Title: 嫦娥奔月
- Cultural Origin: Chinese
- Required Language: 中文

**CHARACTERS:**
- 后羿 (Hero)
- 逄蒙 (Villain)
- 嫦娥 (Lover) - also known as: 后羿妻子
- 西王母 (Ruler)
- 玉兔 (Other)

Each character has an archetypal role. Develop them in a way that is consistent with their archetype while also giving them depth and personality. Use character names consistently throughout the story, including any aliases provided.

**NARRATIVE STRUCTURE:**

The story must follow these 8 events in the exact order specified. Each event must correspond to ONE paragraph in your output, wrapped in curly braces {}:

Event 1: [SOLUTION] 英雄解决了自然灾害;后羿射日 | Agents: 后羿 | Targets: 多余的太阳
Event 2: [TRICKERY] 徒弟假意拜师,但心怀不轨 | Agents: 逄蒙 | Targets: 后羿
Event 3: [RECEIPT_OF_AGENT] 丈夫为了妻子放弃了魔法物品的使用;后羿出于对嫦娥的爱放弃了使用仙药 | Agents: 后羿 | Targets: 嫦娥 | Instrument: 仙药
Event 4: [VILLAINY] 反派试图抢夺宝物; | Agents: 逄蒙 | Targets: 嫦娥
Event 5: [STRUGGLE] 英雄的爱人用智慧与反派周旋 | Agents: 嫦娥 | Targets: 逄蒙
Event 6: [STRUGGLE] 英雄的爱人为了阻止反派, 抢先使用魔法物品; 嫦娥为了阻止逄蒙吞服仙药 | Agents: 嫦娥 | Targets: 仙药
Event 7: [TRANSFIGURATION] 嫦娥奔月 | Agents: 嫦娥 | Targets: 月亮
Event 8: [ABSENTATION]  | Agents: 后羿 | Targets: 嫦娥

Each event represents a key plot point that must be included in your narrative. The event type (e.g., VILLAINY, DEPARTURE, VICTORY) indicates the narrative function, which should inform how you present and develop that moment in the story. You must generate exactly 8 paragraphs, each wrapped in {}, corresponding to these 8 events in order.

**STORY GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Narrative Flow**: The story must progress smoothly through all events in chronological order. Create natural transitions between events that feel organic and engaging.

2. **Character Development**: Include all listed characters and develop their roles naturally. Characters should feel authentic to their archetypal roles while also having individual personalities.

3. **Cultural Authenticity**: 
   - Use appropriate cultural details, settings, and traditions for Chinese folktales
   - Incorporate relevant cultural elements, motifs, and storytelling conventions
   - Maintain the traditional narrative style typical of Chinese stories

4. **Writing Style**:
   - Use vivid, descriptive language that brings scenes to life
   - Include sensory details (sights, sounds, emotions) where appropriate
   - Balance dialogue and narration effectively
   - Create tension and emotional resonance where the events suggest it

5. **Completeness**: The story should be self-contained and readable as a standalone narrative. Do not include meta-commentary, explanations, or analysis—only the story itself.

6. **Length**: Generate a substantial, well-developed story that fully explores each event. Aim for a length appropriate to the complexity of the narrative structure provided.

**OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL:**

You must format the story as follows:
- Each narrative event corresponds to ONE story paragraph
- Each paragraph MUST be wrapped in curly braces {}
- The paragraphs must appear in the exact order of the events (Event 1, Event 2, ..., Event 8)
- Each paragraph should be a self-contained narrative segment that develops the corresponding event

Format example:
{First paragraph corresponding to Event 1}
{Second paragraph corresponding to Event 2}
{Third paragraph corresponding to Event 3}
...

Requirements:
- Each {} block should contain the story text for ONE narrative event only
- Do NOT include any text outside the curly braces
- Do NOT include the event numbers or labels inside the braces
- Do NOT include any introduction, explanation, meta-commentary, notes, or analysis
- Do NOT include the title
- The story should flow naturally from one {} block to the next

**LANGUAGE REMINDER:**
CRITICAL: You must write the entire story in 中文, not in English. The story must be completely in 中文 from the first word to the last word. Do not use English at all.
