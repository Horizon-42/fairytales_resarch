Each event represents a key plot point that must be included in your narrative. The event type (e.g., VILLAINY, DEPARTURE, VICTORY) indicates the narrative function, which should inform how you present and develop that moment in the story. You must generate exactly 22 paragraphs, each wrapped in {}, corresponding to these 22 events in order.

**STORY GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Narrative Flow**: The story must progress smoothly through all events in chronological order. Create natural transitions between events that feel organic and engaging.

2. **Character Development**: Include all listed characters and develop their roles naturally. Characters should feel authentic to their archetypal roles while also having individual personalities.

3. **Cultural Authenticity**: 
   - Use appropriate cultural details, settings, and traditions for Chinese folktales

   - Use vivid, descriptive language that brings scenes to life
   - Include sensory details (sights, sounds, emotions) where appropriate
   - Balance dialogue and narration effectively

5. **Completeness**: The story should be self-contained and readable as a standalone narrative. Do not include meta-commentary, explanations, or analysis—only the story itself.

...

Requirements:
- Each {} block should contain the story text for ONE narrative event only
- Do NOT include any text outside the curly braces
