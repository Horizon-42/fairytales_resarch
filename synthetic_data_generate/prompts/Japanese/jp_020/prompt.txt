You are a master storyteller with deep expertise in Japanese folktales, myths, and traditional narratives. Your task is to create a complete, engaging story that faithfully follows the provided narrative structure while bringing it to life with rich detail and cultural authenticity.

**CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST write the entire story in Japanese. This is not optional. Every word, sentence, and paragraph must be in Japanese, not English or any other language.

**STORY INFORMATION:**
- Title: 
- Cultural Origin: Japanese
- Required Language: Japanese

**CHARACTERS:**
- 男 (Everyman)
- 白いひげのおじいさん (Mentor)
- 兄さん (Villain)

Each character has an archetypal role. Develop them in a way that is consistent with their archetype while also giving them depth and personality. Use character names consistently throughout the story, including any aliases provided.

**NARRATIVE STRUCTURE:**

The story must follow these 10 events in the exact order specified. Each event must correspond to ONE paragraph in your output, wrapped in curly braces {}:

Event 1: [Initial Situation] むかしむかし、ある村に、貧乏な男がいました。 | Agents: 男
Event 2: [FIRST_FUNCTION_DONOR] ある日の晩、その男のところへ、白いひげのおじいさんがやってきました。
「道に迷ったので、一晩泊めてくだされ」 | Agents: 白いひげのおじいさん | Targets: 男
Event 3: [HERO_REACTION] 「ああ、それはお困りでしょう。いいですとも。さあどうぞ」
　男は親切に、おじいさんを泊めてやりました。 | Agents: 男 | Targets: 白いひげのおじいさん
Event 4: [RECEIPT_OF_AGENT] 次の日、おじいさんは男に小さな石うすをくれました。 | Agents: 白いひげのおじいさん | Targets: 男
Event 5: [GUIDANCE] これは不思議な石うすでな、右へ回せば欲しい物が出て、左へ回せば止まるんじゃ。止めるまで出続けるから、気をつけるんじゃぞ」 | Agents: 白いひげのおじいさん | Targets: 男
Event 6: [LIQUIDATION] 男はためしに、石うすを回してみました。
「米出ろ、米出ろ」
　すると石うすから、まっ白い米がザクザクと出てきました。 | Agents: 男
Event 7: [RECONNAISSANCE] こっそりのぞきにきました。
「そうか、なるほど。全ては、あの石うすのおかげだな。しめしめ」 | Agents: 兄さん | Targets: 男
Event 8: [VILLAINY] 兄さんは夜になると弟の家に忍び込んで、石うすを盗みました。 | Agents: 兄さん | Targets: 男
Event 9: [VIOLATION] よーし、塩出ろ、塩出ろ」
と、石うすを回すと、石うすからは塩がザラザラとあふれ出して、たちまち舟いっぱいになりました。 | Agents: 兄さん | Targets: 石うす
Event 10: [PUNISHMENT] 舟は塩の重さに耐えられなくなり、そのまま海に沈んでしまいました。 | Agents: 兄さん | Targets: 兄さん

Each event represents a key plot point that must be included in your narrative. The event type (e.g., VILLAINY, DEPARTURE, VICTORY) indicates the narrative function, which should inform how you present and develop that moment in the story. You must generate exactly 10 paragraphs, each wrapped in {}, corresponding to these 10 events in order.

**STORY GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Narrative Flow**: The story must progress smoothly through all events in chronological order. Create natural transitions between events that feel organic and engaging.

2. **Character Development**: Include all listed characters and develop their roles naturally. Characters should feel authentic to their archetypal roles while also having individual personalities.

3. **Cultural Authenticity**: 
   - Use appropriate cultural details, settings, and traditions for Japanese folktales
   - Incorporate relevant cultural elements, motifs, and storytelling conventions
   - Maintain the traditional narrative style typical of Japanese stories

4. **Writing Style**:
   - Use vivid, descriptive language that brings scenes to life
   - Include sensory details (sights, sounds, emotions) where appropriate
   - Balance dialogue and narration effectively
   - Create tension and emotional resonance where the events suggest it

5. **Completeness**: The story should be self-contained and readable as a standalone narrative. Do not include meta-commentary, explanations, or analysis—only the story itself.

6. **Length**: Generate a substantial, well-developed story that fully explores each event. Aim for a length appropriate to the complexity of the narrative structure provided.

**OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL:**

You must format the story as follows:
- Each narrative event corresponds to ONE story paragraph
- Each paragraph MUST be wrapped in curly braces {}
- The paragraphs must appear in the exact order of the events (Event 1, Event 2, ..., Event 10)
- Each paragraph should be a self-contained narrative segment that develops the corresponding event

Format example:
{First paragraph corresponding to Event 1}
{Second paragraph corresponding to Event 2}
{Third paragraph corresponding to Event 3}
...

Requirements:
- Each {} block should contain the story text for ONE narrative event only
- Do NOT include any text outside the curly braces
- Do NOT include the event numbers or labels inside the braces
- Do NOT include any introduction, explanation, meta-commentary, notes, or analysis
- Do NOT include the title
- The story should flow naturally from one {} block to the next

**LANGUAGE REMINDER:**
CRITICAL: You must write the entire story in Japanese, not in English. The story must be completely in Japanese from the first word to the last word. Do not use English at all.
