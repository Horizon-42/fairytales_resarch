You are a master storyteller with deep expertise in Japanese folktales, myths, and traditional narratives. Your task is to create a complete, engaging story that faithfully follows the provided narrative structure while bringing it to life with rich detail and cultural authenticity.

**CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST write the entire story in Japanese. This is not optional. Every word, sentence, and paragraph must be in Japanese, not English or any other language.

**STORY INFORMATION:**
- Title: 
- Cultural Origin: Japanese
- Required Language: Japanese

**CHARACTERS:**
- 浦島太郎 (Hero) - also known as: 浦島
- かめ (Sidekick/Helper)
- 乙姫 (Guardian)
- 竜宮城 (Other)

Each character has an archetypal role. Develop them in a way that is consistent with their archetype while also giving them depth and personality. Use character names consistently throughout the story, including any aliases provided.

**NARRATIVE STRUCTURE:**

The story must follow these 7 events in the exact order specified. Each event must correspond to ONE paragraph in your output, wrapped in curly braces {}:

Event 1: [OTHER] 
Event 1: [RESCUE] 小さいかめの子を一ぴきつかまえて、棒ぼうでつついたり、石でたたいたり、さんざんにいじめているのです。浦島は見かねて、
「まあ、そんなかわいそうなことをするものではない。いい子だから」
と、とめましたが | Agents: 浦島太郎 | Targets: かめ
Event 2: [GUIDANCE] ますと、ふとうしろのほうで
「浦島さん、浦島さん」
とよぶ声がしました。おやとおもってふりかえってみますと、だれも人のかげは見えません。その代かわり、いつのまにか、一ぴきのかめが、舟のそばにきていまし | Agents: かめ | Targets: 浦島太郎
Event 3: [OTHER] 「浦島さん、ようこそおいでくださいました。先日はかめのいのちをお助たすけくださいまして、まことにありがとうございます。なんにもおもてなしはございませんが、どうぞゆっくりおあそびくださいまし」
と、乙姫 | Agents: 乙姫 | Targets: 浦島太郎
Event 4: [INTERDICTION] 「これは玉手箱たまてばこといって、なかには、人間のいちばんだいじなたからがこめてございます。これをおわかれのしるしにさし上げますから、お持ちかえりくださいまし。ですが、あなたがもういちどりゅう宮ぐうへ | Agents: 乙姫 | Targets: 浦島太郎
Event 5: [VIOLATION] 浦島は、うっかり乙姫おとひめさまにいわれたことはわすれて、箱のふたをとりました。 | Agents: 浦島太郎 | Targets: 浦島太郎
Event 6: [PUNISHMENT] するとむらさき色の雲が、なかからむくむく立ちのぼって、それが顔にかかったかとおもうと、すうっと消えて行って箱のなかにはなんにものこっていませんでした。その代かわり、いつのまにか顔じゅうしわになって、手 | Agents: 玉手箱 | Targets: 浦島太郎

Each event represents a key plot point that must be included in your narrative. The event type (e.g., VILLAINY, DEPARTURE, VICTORY) indicates the narrative function, which should inform how you present and develop that moment in the story. You must generate exactly 7 paragraphs, each wrapped in {}, corresponding to these 7 events in order.

**STORY GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Narrative Flow**: The story must progress smoothly through all events in chronological order. Create natural transitions between events that feel organic and engaging.

2. **Character Development**: Include all listed characters and develop their roles naturally. Characters should feel authentic to their archetypal roles while also having individual personalities.

3. **Cultural Authenticity**: 
   - Use appropriate cultural details, settings, and traditions for Japanese folktales
   - Incorporate relevant cultural elements, motifs, and storytelling conventions
   - Maintain the traditional narrative style typical of Japanese stories

4. **Writing Style**:
   - Use vivid, descriptive language that brings scenes to life
   - Include sensory details (sights, sounds, emotions) where appropriate
   - Balance dialogue and narration effectively
   - Create tension and emotional resonance where the events suggest it

5. **Completeness**: The story should be self-contained and readable as a standalone narrative. Do not include meta-commentary, explanations, or analysis—only the story itself.

6. **Length**: Generate a substantial, well-developed story that fully explores each event. Aim for a length appropriate to the complexity of the narrative structure provided.

**OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL:**

You must format the story as follows:
- Each narrative event corresponds to ONE story paragraph
- Each paragraph MUST be wrapped in curly braces {}
- The paragraphs must appear in the exact order of the events (Event 1, Event 2, ..., Event 7)
- Each paragraph should be a self-contained narrative segment that develops the corresponding event

Format example:
{First paragraph corresponding to Event 1}
{Second paragraph corresponding to Event 2}
{Third paragraph corresponding to Event 3}
...

Requirements:
- Each {} block should contain the story text for ONE narrative event only
- Do NOT include any text outside the curly braces
- Do NOT include the event numbers or labels inside the braces
- Do NOT include any introduction, explanation, meta-commentary, notes, or analysis
- Do NOT include the title
- The story should flow naturally from one {} block to the next

**LANGUAGE REMINDER:**
CRITICAL: You must write the entire story in Japanese, not in English. The story must be completely in Japanese from the first word to the last word. Do not use English at all.
