This precious grain, saved from his meager alms, he carefully stored in an old, unglazed earthen pot. He hung this pot from a peg on the wall of his simple dwelling, directly above his sleeping mat, so that it might always be within his watchful gaze.

His mind, unburdened by the day's trivialities, began to spin an elaborate tapestry of future fortune. \"This rice,\" he mused to himself, \"will multiply. I shall sell it for a handsome sum, and with that money, I will purchase more rice, and then still more. Soon, I shall have a warehouse brimming with grains, and from its sale, I shall acquire a herd of cattle, then horses, and finally, vast tracts of land.

She will be a wife worthy of my station, and together we shall have many children, strong sons and charming daughters.

His imaginary son's defiance, his beautiful daughter's (his wife's) perceived indulgence, and his own rising anger felt utterly real. With a sudden, forceful thrust, intending to reprimand his unruly, phantom child and assert his domestic dominion, Svabhavakripana raised his leg and delivered a swift, resounding kick. His foot connected not with an imaginary foe, but with the very real earthen pot hanging above his head, shattering it instantly. The pot splintered into a thousand pieces, and the precious surplus rice rained down upon his face and mat, mixing with the dust of his shattered dreams.\n\nSummary:\nSvabhavakripana, a miserly Brahman, hoards a small amount of rice in a pot, imagining it will grow into vast wealth and power.

This tale serves as a timeless caution to all who listen: do not count your chickens before they hatch, nor construct castles in the sky before laying a single brick on solid ground. For often, the very act of planning too far ahead, without grounding oneself in the present, leads only to the destruction of what little one truly possesses, leaving only shattered fragments and the bitter taste of unrealized ambition.\n\nSummary:\nSvabhavakripana, a miserly Brahman, hoards a small amount of rice in a pot, imagining it will grow into vast wealth and power.
