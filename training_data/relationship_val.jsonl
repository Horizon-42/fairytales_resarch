As age began to settle upon his shoulders like a heavy shawl, he decided, in a moment of trusting love, to divide his considerable wealth – his fertile lands, a chest of precious jewels, and bags of gleaming gold coins – among his two robust young sons, Ravi and Suresh. He envisioned a peaceful retirement, cared for by his grateful offspring. However, no sooner had the last deed been signed and the last coin counted than the sons, revealing their true, wretched natures, transformed into selfish ingrates. The Old Man's comforts vanished; his warm meals became meager scraps, his soft bed a cold mat, and his pleas for kindness were met with harsh words and cold stares. He was a burden, neglected and abused, left to languish in a corner of his own former home, his heart heavy with bitter regret.\n\nSummary:\nGopal, an elderly man, divides his wealth between his greedy sons, Ravi and Suresh, only to be neglected and abused after their betrayal. His loyal friend Rama deceives them into believing hidden treasure exists, manipulating their greed to secure Gopal's comfort. The sons, fooled into revering their father, later dig futilely for the supposed treasure, uncovering only emptiness.

Their avarice, once directed at their father’s initial wealth, now fixated on this tantalizing, hidden hoard. With astonishing speed, their cruel neglect was replaced by exaggerated reverence. They bathed the Old Man with scented water, brought him sumptuous meals served on shining brass plates, draped him in soft, freshly laundered kurtas, and spoke to him with unctuous politeness, inquiring about his health and comfort with feigned filial devotion. Gopal, understanding the game, played his part masterfully. He would smile faintly, hint at a \"special place\" known only to him, or speak of \"the right time\" to reveal the treasure, keeping his sons enthralled and ensuring his own comfort for the remaining days of his life, observing their transparent trickery with a quiet, knowing amusement.\n\nSummary:\nGopal, an elderly man, divides his wealth between his greedy sons, Ravi and Suresh, only to be neglected and abused after their betrayal.
