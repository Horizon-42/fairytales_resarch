But you must understand, our relationship is irrevocably broken. The shadow of your son's deed and the pain it has caused both of us means we can no longer share this space. You must leave this place and never return, for the trust between us has been shattered forever.\" With those words, the Guardian Deity retreated deep into the heart of the anthill, vanishing from Haridatta's sight and life, leaving the Brahman clutching the precious pearl, burdened by loss, and forever exiled from the presence of his golden benefactor.\n\nSummary:\nHaridatta, a devout Brahman farmer, discovers a serpent he believes is a guardian deity and offers milk daily, earning gold coins that transform his impoverished life. His greedy son, however, plots to kill the serpent for its supposed treasure, leading to the son's death and the serpent's tragic departure.

Using a cryptic trade song, the Clever Merchant subtly coordinates a coordinated attack, enabling the merchants to overpower the robbers and reclaim their stolen goods. Their triumph transforms them from victims to heroes, celebrated for their unity and ingenuity in overcoming tyranny. The story underscores the power of clever strategy and collective resolve against oppression.\n\n\nKey Propp Functions (select one code):\n- alpha: Initial Situation (intro of hero/family)\n- beta: Absentation (authority leaves)\n- gamma: Interdiction (hero warned)\n- delta: Violation (rule broken)\n- epsilon: Reconnaissance (villain gathers info)\n- zeta: Delivery (villain gets info)\n- eta: Trickery (villain deceives)\n- theta: Complicity (victim submits)\n- A: Villainy (villain causes harm) [Driver Type 1]\n- a: Lack (family lacks something) [Driver Type 2]\n- B: Mediation (hero dispatched)\n- C: Counteraction (hero decides)\n- arrow_up: Departure (hero leaves)\n- D: 1st Function of Donor (hero tested)\n- E: Hero's Reaction (responds to test)\n- F: Receipt of Agent (acquires magical item)\n- G: Guidance (transferred to location)\n- H: Struggle (combat with villain)\n- J: Branding (hero wounded/marked)\n- I: Victory (villain defeated)\n- K: Liquidation (lack/villainy resolved)\n- arrow_down: Return (hero returns)\n- Pr: Pursuit (hero pursued)\n- Rs: Rescue (hero rescued)\n- o: Unrecognized Arrival (disguised)\n- L: Unfounded Claims (false hero claims)\n- M: Difficult Task (task proposed)\n- N: Solution (task resolved)\n- Q: Recognition (hero recognized)\n- Ex: Exposure (false hero/villain exposed)\n- T: Transfiguration (new appearance/status)\n- U: Punishment (villain punished)\n- W: Wedding (ultimate reward)\n- OTHER: If none fit\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"Propp function code (e.g., 'A', 'a', 'B', or 'OTHER')\",\n  \"description_general\": \"general description (e.g., 'monster kills hero's family')\",\n  \"description_specific\": \"specific description (e.g., 'wolf eats Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother')\"\n}\n\nNote: If the event fits no specific Propp function, use \"OTHER\".\nCombine the two descriptions with semicolon: \"general;specific\"\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"event_type\": \"LIQUIDATION\", \"description_general\": \"The merchants recover their stolen goods and return home as heroes.\", \"description_specific\": \"\"}"}

He envisioned a peaceful retirement, cared for by his grateful offspring. However, no sooner had the last deed been signed and the last coin counted than the sons, revealing their true, wretched natures, transformed into selfish ingrates.

Their avarice, once directed at their father’s initial wealth, now fixated on this tantalizing, hidden hoard. With astonishing speed, their cruel neglect was replaced by exaggerated reverence. They bathed the Old Man with scented water, brought him sumptuous meals served on shining brass plates, draped him in soft, freshly laundered kurtas, and spoke to him with unctuous politeness, inquiring about his health and comfort with feigned filial devotion. Gopal, understanding the game, played his part masterfully. He would smile faintly, hint at a \"special place\" known only to him, or speak of \"the right time\" to reveal the treasure, keeping his sons enthralled and ensuring his own comfort for the remaining days of his life, observing their transparent trickery with a quiet, knowing amusement.\n\nSummary:\nGopal, an elderly man, divides his wealth between his greedy sons, Ravi and Suresh, only to be neglected and abused after their betrayal.

His sons, Ravi and Suresh, performed the funeral rites with an extravagant show of grief, though their minds were fixated solely on the imminent unveiling of the hidden treasure. No sooner were the ceremonies concluded than the wretched, selfish ingrates armed themselves with spades and shovels. They fell upon the ancestral land with a furious energy, digging relentlessly, turning over every clod of earth, uprooting ancient trees, and demolishing old stone walls. For days they toiled, their greed pushing them onward, until the once-fertile plot resembled a battlefield of craters and overturned soil. But all they unearthed was rock and common earth. The horrifying realization, a bitter and crushing truth, finally dawned upon them: there was no gold, no gems, only the vast emptiness of their own folly. They had been duped, tricked by their own father, and the only treasure they had secured was a ruined field and the agonizing knowledge that their greed had been their undoing, a punishment they had inflicted upon themselves.\n\nSummary:\nGopal, an elderly man, divides his wealth between his greedy sons, Ravi and Suresh, only to be neglected and abused after their betrayal.

The air was thick with the aroma of cardamoms, saffron, and roasted spices, and platters laden with the richest delicacies, sweet laddoos, and fragrant curries stretched as far as the eye could see. Sun, the Eldest, with his boisterous hunger, devoured every morsel he could reach, thinking only of his own satisfaction. Wind, equally unrestrained, swept through the dishes, tasting and consuming without a moment's pause. But Gentle Moon, the Daughter, with her quiet grace and ever-thoughtful heart, carefully wrapped a small parcel of the finest sweets and a portion of fragrant rice in a fresh banana leaf, intending to bring it home for their dear Mother, Star, who had stayed behind to watch over the universe.\n\nSummary:\nIn a celestial realm, Sun, Moon, and Wind, children of Star, attend a lavish feast hosted by their uncle and aunts. While Sun and Wind indulge selfishly, Moon remembers to save a gift for their absent mother, Star.

The hall shimmered with divine light, tables groaned under the weight of ambrosial sweets, fragrant rice, and countless delicacies prepared with celestial love.
