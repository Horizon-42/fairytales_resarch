One day, after a particularly fortunate begging round, he found himself with a small surplus of rice—just enough to fill a modest earthen pot. With meticulous care, Svabhavakripana hung the pot from a rafter directly above his sleeping mat, securing it with an old, knotted rope.

He gazed at the pot, his eyes gleaming with a strange mixture of contentment and avarice, the precious grains representing not just a meal, but the seed of a grander future.\nAs the night deepened and the village hushed, Svabhavakripana lay awake, his eyes fixed on the pot of rice. His mind, unburdened by sleep, began to weave an intricate tapestry of prosperity. \"This rice,\" he mused to himself, \"I shall sell it for a small profit. With that profit, I shall buy more rice, much more, and trade it in the bustling market for even greater gains. Soon, I will have enough silver to purchase a flock of goats, then a herd of cows, whose milk and offspring will fetch me a fortune in gold. Lands I shall acquire, vast fields yielding bountiful harvests, and stately mansions shall rise under my name. Oh, what a wealthy man I, Svabhavakripana, shall become!\"\nHis fantasy spiraled further, painting vivid scenes of a life far removed from his current destitution. With his newfound immense wealth, he resolved, he would marry a beautiful daughter from a respectable, affluent family, a woman of grace and charm who would become his loving wife. Soon, he imagined, a sturdy, bright-eyed son would bless their union, a true heir to his burgeoning empire. He pictured the child playing, and then, in a sudden shift of his dream, his wife—the beautiful daughter—would neglect their son, leaving him unattended. His imagined frustration grew, and he envisioned himself sternly rebuking her, his voice booming with the authority of a wealthy householder.\nLost in this elaborate mental drama, the imaginary scolding of his disobedient wife intensified. \"Woman!\" he roared, though only in his mind, \"How dare you neglect our son! I will teach you a lesson!\" In his furious delusion, Svabhavakripana forgot his present reality entirely. He raised his leg, intending to deliver a swift, punishing kick to his imaginary wife in his dream, but instead, his foot connected with a sharp crack against the very pot hanging above him. The earthen pot shattered into a thousand pieces, showering him with dust and the precious grains of rice that now lay scattered uselessly across his sleeping mat, marking the abrupt, devastating end of his grand vision.\nAnd so, dear He who listens to my tale, you see the folly of Svabhavakripana, the born miser. For those who build magnificent castles in the air, imagining fortunes and futures before the first brick of reality is laid, often find themselves with nothing but shattered dreams and spilled rice. It is a timeless lesson: one must not count the chickens before they hatch, nor anticipate the fruits of labor before the seeds are even sown.
