His mind, unburdened by the day's trivialities, began to spin an elaborate tapestry of future fortune. \"This rice,\" he mused to himself, \"will multiply. I shall sell it for a handsome sum, and with that money, I will purchase more rice, and then still more. Soon, I shall have a warehouse brimming with grains, and from its sale, I shall acquire a herd of cattle, then horses, and finally, vast tracts of land. I, Svabhavakripana, shall become a merchant king, lauded throughout the land for my immense wealth!\"\nHis fantasy did not stop at riches. \"Once I am rich beyond measure,\" he continued to himself, his voice a low, excited whisper in the quiet room, \"I shall marry a beautiful daughter of a prominent family. She will be a wife worthy of my station, and together we shall have many children, strong sons and charming daughters. One day, a son of mine will be disobedient, perhaps demanding sweetmeats when he should be studying. And when my wife, that beautiful daughter, tries to intervene, I will chastise her, reminding her of my authority in the household, for I am the master!\"\nLost completely in this vivid daydream, Svabhavakripana forgot his present reality. His imaginary son's defiance, his beautiful daughter's (his wife's) perceived indulgence, and his own rising anger felt utterly real. With a sudden, forceful thrust, intending to reprimand his unruly, phantom child and assert his domestic dominion, Svabhavakripana raised his leg and delivered a swift, resounding kick. His foot connected not with an imaginary foe, but with the very real earthen pot hanging above his head, shattering it instantly. The pot splintered into a thousand pieces, and the precious surplus rice rained down upon his face and mat, mixing with the dust of his shattered dreams.\nAlas, dear He, observe the folly of Svabhavakripana, a man who built an empire of air upon a handful of rice. This tale serves as a timeless caution to all who listen: do not count your chickens before they hatch, nor construct castles in the sky before laying a single brick on solid ground.
