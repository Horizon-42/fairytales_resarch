He hurried home, fetched a bowl of fresh, creamy milk, perfumed it with a sprinkle of sandalwood, and reverently placed it before the majestic serpent, bowing low and murmuring ancient prayers for appeasement and prosperity.\nTo Haridatta's astonishment and immense joy, the very next morning, he found the bowl empty, the milk consumed. And where the bowl had rested, now glittered a single, perfectly minted gold coin, shimmering under the nascent sun. Overwhelmed with gratitude and convinced of the serpent's divine favor, Haridatta continued his daily ritual, placing an offering of milk each dawn. Without fail, the serpent reciprocated, leaving a shining gold coin in return, transforming the Brahman's impoverished existence into one of comfort and quiet contentment, filling his granary and mending his tattered robes.\nHaridatta's good fortune, however, did not escape the notice of his only son, a young man whose heart was tainted by avarice and a craving for quick riches. Witnessing the daily exchange, the son’s mind, devoid of reverence and respect for the sacred, quickly dismissed any notion of divine blessings. He concluded, with cunning greed, that the entire anthill must be teeming with a vast, untold hoard of gold, and the serpent merely an inconvenience, a living obstacle to untold wealth. He decided that he would violently claim the treasure for himself, plotting to kill the serpent during its daily appearance.\nThe very next day, as Haridatta departed for the village market, his son seized his opportunity. Armed with a heavy club, he stealthily approached the anthill. As the unsuspecting serpent emerged, its scales gleaming, to receive its usual offering, the son raised his weapon and struck with all his might. Though the blow was aimed to be fatal, the swift serpent narrowly dodged the full impact, suffering a painful, glancing wound. In a flash of instinctual self-preservation, the enraged Guardian Deity lunged forward, sinking its venomous fangs deep into the son's arm. The poison was potent and swift; the young man gasped once, swayed, and collapsed lifelessly to the dusty earth, his dreams of gold perishing with him.\nWhen Haridatta returned later that day to discover his son's cold, still form beside the sacred anthill, grief tore through him like a monsoon storm. Yet, amidst his shattering sorrow, a profound understanding dawned: his son’s reckless greed had sealed his own tragic fate. Despite the immense pain, Haridatta’s deep-seated reverence for the serpent remained. The following morning, his eyes swollen with tears, he approached the anthill once more, placing the fresh milk offering as was his custom, hoping to somehow mend the broken bond. The serpent emerged, its gaze somber, and spoke, its voice like the rustling of dry leaves: \"Haridatta, how can I ever again trust you or your lineage? Your son sought to kill me for gold, and though I acted in defense, my heart is burdened. There can be no true peace or growth where such a terrible act has occurred and where the blood of a child stains the soil between us.\"\nWith a sorrowful, almost human sigh, the Serpent then produced a single, luminous pearl, larger and more radiant than any jewel Haridatta had ever seen, and gently nudged it towards him. \"This,\" it declared, its voice resonant with finality, \"is my last gift to you, a memento of our past kindness. But you must understand, our relationship is irrevocably broken. The shadow of your son's deed and the pain it has caused both of us means we can no longer share this space. You must leave this place and never return, for the trust between us has been shattered forever.\" With those words, the Guardian Deity retreated deep into the heart of the anthill, vanishing from Haridatta's sight and life, leaving the Brahman clutching the precious pearl, burdened by loss, and forever exiled from the presence of his golden benefactor.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Haridatta\"], \"receivers\": [\"The Serpent\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"The Serpent\", \"alias\": \"Guardian Deity of the Field\", \"archetype\": \"Other\"}, {\"name\": \"Haridatta\", \"alias\": \"The Brahman\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

He hurried home, fetched a bowl of fresh, creamy milk, perfumed it with a sprinkle of sandalwood, and reverently placed it before the majestic serpent, bowing low and murmuring ancient prayers for appeasement and prosperity.\nTo Haridatta's astonishment and immense joy, the very next morning, he found the bowl empty, the milk consumed. And where the bowl had rested, now glittered a single, perfectly minted gold coin, shimmering under the nascent sun. Overwhelmed with gratitude and convinced of the serpent's divine favor, Haridatta continued his daily ritual, placing an offering of milk each dawn. Without fail, the serpent reciprocated, leaving a shining gold coin in return, transforming the Brahman's impoverished existence into one of comfort and quiet contentment, filling his granary and mending his tattered robes.\nHaridatta's good fortune, however, did not escape the notice of his only son, a young man whose heart was tainted by avarice and a craving for quick riches. Witnessing the daily exchange, the son’s mind, devoid of reverence and respect for the sacred, quickly dismissed any notion of divine blessings. He concluded, with cunning greed, that the entire anthill must be teeming with a vast, untold hoard of gold, and the serpent merely an inconvenience, a living obstacle to untold wealth. He decided that he would violently claim the treasure for himself, plotting to kill the serpent during its daily appearance.\nThe very next day, as Haridatta departed for the village market, his son seized his opportunity. Armed with a heavy club, he stealthily approached the anthill. As the unsuspecting serpent emerged, its scales gleaming, to receive its usual offering, the son raised his weapon and struck with all his might. Though the blow was aimed to be fatal, the swift serpent narrowly dodged the full impact, suffering a painful, glancing wound. In a flash of instinctual self-preservation, the enraged Guardian Deity lunged forward, sinking its venomous fangs deep into the son's arm. The poison was potent and swift; the young man gasped once, swayed, and collapsed lifelessly to the dusty earth, his dreams of gold perishing with him.\nWhen Haridatta returned later that day to discover his son's cold, still form beside the sacred anthill, grief tore through him like a monsoon storm. Yet, amidst his shattering sorrow, a profound understanding dawned: his son’s reckless greed had sealed his own tragic fate. Despite the immense pain, Haridatta’s deep-seated reverence for the serpent remained. The following morning, his eyes swollen with tears, he approached the anthill once more, placing the fresh milk offering as was his custom, hoping to somehow mend the broken bond. The serpent emerged, its gaze somber, and spoke, its voice like the rustling of dry leaves: \"Haridatta, how can I ever again trust you or your lineage? Your son sought to kill me for gold, and though I acted in defense, my heart is burdened. There can be no true peace or growth where such a terrible act has occurred and where the blood of a child stains the soil between us.\"\nWith a sorrowful, almost human sigh, the Serpent then produced a single, luminous pearl, larger and more radiant than any jewel Haridatta had ever seen, and gently nudged it towards him. \"This,\" it declared, its voice resonant with finality, \"is my last gift to you, a memento of our past kindness. But you must understand, our relationship is irrevocably broken. The shadow of your son's deed and the pain it has caused both of us means we can no longer share this space. You must leave this place and never return, for the trust between us has been shattered forever.\" With those words, the Guardian Deity retreated deep into the heart of the anthill, vanishing from Haridatta's sight and life, leaving the Brahman clutching the precious pearl, burdened by loss, and forever exiled from the presence of his golden benefactor.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"The Serpent\"], \"receivers\": [\"Haridatta\"], \"new_characters\": [], \"notes\": \"\"}"}
