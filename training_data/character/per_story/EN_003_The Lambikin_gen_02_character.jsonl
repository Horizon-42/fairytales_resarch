One bright morning, bidding farewell to the familiar warmth of his pen and the gentle bleats of his mother, he decided it was time to trot along the dusty village path to her distant home. His tiny hooves skipped lightly over pebbles, his heart filled with innocent excitement for the journey ahead, unaware of the lurking dangers that often prowled beyond the secure fences of his family's farm.\nAs Wee wee Lambikin rounded a bend shaded by a gnarled banyan tree, a shadowy form emerged from the undergrowth. It was a lean, hungry Jackal, its eyes glinting with malicious intent. \"Aha!\" snarled the Jackal, blocking the path with its wiry body. \"What a plump little morsel you are! I haven't had such a delicious breakfast in ages. Prepare to be my meal, Wee wee Lambikin!\"\nWee wee Lambikin, though startled, quickly composed himself. \"Oh, most magnificent Jackal!\" he piped up, his voice trembling only slightly. \"Surely you wouldn't want to eat me now, when I am but a scrawny thing? I am on my way to my Granny's house, where she has a vast corn-bin. Let me go, eat my fill, and grow plump and juicy. Then, on my return, you may devour a much more satisfying feast!\" The Jackal, envisioning an even grander meal, licked its chops and, with a sly grin, agreed, \"Very well, little one. But remember your promise!\"\nFurther along the winding track, a colossal Vulture descended from the sky, casting an enormous shadow over Wee wee Lambikin. Its beady eyes, sharp as obsidian chips, fixed upon the small lamb. \"Little one,\" rasped the Vulture, its voice like dry leaves scraping, \"you look rather tender. You would make a delightful mid-morning snack.\" Undeterred, Wee wee Lambikin repeated his plea, \"Honored Vulture, I am but a lean morsel now. Permit me to reach my Granny's, where her corn-bin awaits. I promise to return a much fatter, more succulent feast for your aerial majesty.\" The Vulture, always one for a better prospect, tilted its bald head thoughtfully and croaked its assent, allowing the Lambikin to pass.\nWee wee Lambikin continued his journey, encountering a succession of hungry creatures. First, a fearsome Tiger with stripes like shadows in the jungle, then a slavering Wolf whose breath smelled of the wild, a scruffy village Dog with a menacing bark, and even a sharp-taloned Eagle circling overhead. To each and every Predator, the clever Lambikin offered the same enticing promise: \"Wait for me until I return from Granny's corn-bin, and I shall be a far more satisfying meal!\" Each Predator, swayed by the prospect of a richer bounty, allowed him to continue his journey, their eyes gleaming with anticipated delight.\nFinally, Wee wee Lambikin arrived at his Granny's humble but welcoming dwelling. Granny, a sweet-faced woman with kind eyes and hands wrinkled from a lifetime of caring, was overjoyed to see her grandson. She led him straight to the large, brimming corn-bin, filled with golden kernels. For days, Lambikin ate to his heart's content, munching happily on the sweet corn until his little belly grew round and taut, his wool thick and glistening. He was no longer a Wee wee Lambikin, but a truly plump, succulent Lambikin, ready for the journey home – or so he thought.\nWhen the time came for Lambikin to return, Granny, wise to the ways of the jungle and knowing of the many hungry creatures that prowled, hatched a clever plan. \"My dear, you are now too plump to face them,\" she mused. From a sturdy pumpkin shell and some strong wood, she meticulously crafted a small, hollow drum. \"Hide inside this, my precious,\" she instructed, \"and roll yourself home. If any ask who is inside, simply reply with the song I will teach you, and none shall guess it is you.\"\nLambikin, tucked snugly inside the drum, began his rolling journey home. Down the dusty path he tumbled, bumpety-bump, bumpety-bump. Soon, he encountered the very first of his hopeful Predators, the fearsome Tiger, who called out, \"Little drum, little drum, have you seen a Wee wee Lambikin pass this way?\" From within, Lambikin sang out in a muffled, singsong voice, \"No, I haven't, I haven't, I'm a drum, a drum, a drum!\" The Tiger, puzzled but uninterested in a mere drum, let it roll by. The Vulture, too, and the Wolf, the Dog, and the Eagle all asked the same question and received the same deceptive song, allowing the drum to pass, none suspecting the plump cargo within.\nBut as the drum approached the banyan tree where he had first stopped, the clever Jackal sprang out. \"Little drum, little drum, have you seen a Wee wee Lambikin pass this way?\" he yelped. Lambikin, overconfident from his previous successes, sang his little song, \"No, I haven't, I haven't, I'm a drum, a drum, a drum!\" But the Jackal, with a sly tilt of his head, recognized the distinctive lilt in the voice, the very same voice that had promised him a fatter meal. \"Aha!\" he snarled, a triumphant glint in his eyes. \"That's no drum! That's my Wee wee Lambikin, grown fat and juicy!\"\nWith a ferocious growl, the Jackal pounced upon the rolling drum. His sharp claws and teeth tore savagely at the pumpkin shell, ripping it to shreds in moments. Out tumbled the plump, round Lambikin, who barely had time to bleat in terror before the hungry Jackal seized him. The cunning Jackal, having patiently waited and outsmarted all the others, finally had his promised feast. And that, alas, was the end of the brave but ultimately outwitted Lambikin.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Lambikin\"], \"receivers\": [\"self\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"Lambikin\", \"alias\": \"Wee wee Lambikin\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"}, {\"name\": \"self\", \"alias\": \"Lambikin\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

Prepare to be my meal, Wee wee Lambikin!\"\nWee wee Lambikin, though startled, quickly composed himself. \"Oh, most magnificent Jackal!\" he piped up, his voice trembling only slightly. \"Surely you wouldn't want to eat me now, when I am but a scrawny thing? I am on my way to my Granny's house, where she has a vast corn-bin. Let me go, eat my fill, and grow plump and juicy. Then, on my return, you may devour a much more satisfying feast!\" The Jackal, envisioning an even grander meal, licked its chops and, with a sly grin, agreed, \"Very well, little one. But remember your promise!\"\nFurther along the winding track, a colossal Vulture descended from the sky, casting an enormous shadow over Wee wee Lambikin. Its beady eyes, sharp as obsidian chips, fixed upon the small lamb. \"Little one,\" rasped the Vulture, its voice like dry leaves scraping, \"you look rather tender. You would make a delightful mid-morning snack.\" Undeterred, Wee wee Lambikin repeated his plea, \"Honored Vulture, I am but a lean morsel now. Permit me to reach my Granny's, where her corn-bin awaits. I promise to return a much fatter, more succulent feast for your aerial majesty.\" The Vulture, always one for a better prospect, tilted its bald head thoughtfully and croaked its assent, allowing the Lambikin to pass.\nWee wee Lambikin continued his journey, encountering a succession of hungry creatures. First, a fearsome Tiger with stripes like shadows in the jungle, then a slavering Wolf whose breath smelled of the wild, a scruffy village Dog with a menacing bark, and even a sharp-taloned Eagle circling overhead. To each and every Predator, the clever Lambikin offered the same enticing promise: \"Wait for me until I return from Granny's corn-bin, and I shall be a far more satisfying meal!\" Each Predator, swayed by the prospect of a richer bounty, allowed him to continue his journey, their eyes gleaming with anticipated delight.\nFinally, Wee wee Lambikin arrived at his Granny's humble but welcoming dwelling. Granny, a sweet-faced woman with kind eyes and hands wrinkled from a lifetime of caring, was overjoyed to see her grandson. She led him straight to the large, brimming corn-bin, filled with golden kernels. For days, Lambikin ate to his heart's content, munching happily on the sweet corn until his little belly grew round and taut, his wool thick and glistening. He was no longer a Wee wee Lambikin, but a truly plump, succulent Lambikin, ready for the journey home – or so he thought.\nWhen the time came for Lambikin to return, Granny, wise to the ways of the jungle and knowing of the many hungry creatures that prowled, hatched a clever plan. \"My dear, you are now too plump to face them,\" she mused. From a sturdy pumpkin shell and some strong wood, she meticulously crafted a small, hollow drum. \"Hide inside this, my precious,\" she instructed, \"and roll yourself home. If any ask who is inside, simply reply with the song I will teach you, and none shall guess it is you.\"\nLambikin, tucked snugly inside the drum, began his rolling journey home. Down the dusty path he tumbled, bumpety-bump, bumpety-bump. Soon, he encountered the very first of his hopeful Predators, the fearsome Tiger, who called out, \"Little drum, little drum, have you seen a Wee wee Lambikin pass this way?\" From within, Lambikin sang out in a muffled, singsong voice, \"No, I haven't, I haven't, I'm a drum, a drum, a drum!\" The Tiger, puzzled but uninterested in a mere drum, let it roll by. The Vulture, too, and the Wolf, the Dog, and the Eagle all asked the same question and received the same deceptive song, allowing the drum to pass, none suspecting the plump cargo within.\nBut as the drum approached the banyan tree where he had first stopped, the clever Jackal sprang out. \"Little drum, little drum, have you seen a Wee wee Lambikin pass this way?\" he yelped. Lambikin, overconfident from his previous successes, sang his little song, \"No, I haven't, I haven't, I'm a drum, a drum, a drum!\" But the Jackal, with a sly tilt of his head, recognized the distinctive lilt in the voice, the very same voice that had promised him a fatter meal. \"Aha!\" he snarled, a triumphant glint in his eyes. \"That's no drum! That's my Wee wee Lambikin, grown fat and juicy!\"\nWith a ferocious growl, the Jackal pounced upon the rolling drum. His sharp claws and teeth tore savagely at the pumpkin shell, ripping it to shreds in moments. Out tumbled the plump, round Lambikin, who barely had time to bleat in terror before the hungry Jackal seized him. The cunning Jackal, having patiently waited and outsmarted all the others, finally had his promised feast. And that, alas, was the end of the brave but ultimately outwitted Lambikin.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Lambikin\"], \"receivers\": [\"Predator\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"Predator\", \"alias\": \"Tiger\", \"archetype\": \"Villain\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

First, a fearsome Tiger with stripes like shadows in the jungle, then a slavering Wolf whose breath smelled of the wild, a scruffy village Dog with a menacing bark, and even a sharp-taloned Eagle circling overhead. To each and every Predator, the clever Lambikin offered the same enticing promise: \"Wait for me until I return from Granny's corn-bin, and I shall be a far more satisfying meal!\" Each Predator, swayed by the prospect of a richer bounty, allowed him to continue his journey, their eyes gleaming with anticipated delight.\nFinally, Wee wee Lambikin arrived at his Granny's humble but welcoming dwelling. Granny, a sweet-faced woman with kind eyes and hands wrinkled from a lifetime of caring, was overjoyed to see her grandson. She led him straight to the large, brimming corn-bin, filled with golden kernels. For days, Lambikin ate to his heart's content, munching happily on the sweet corn until his little belly grew round and taut, his wool thick and glistening. He was no longer a Wee wee Lambikin, but a truly plump, succulent Lambikin, ready for the journey home – or so he thought.\nWhen the time came for Lambikin to return, Granny, wise to the ways of the jungle and knowing of the many hungry creatures that prowled, hatched a clever plan. \"My dear, you are now too plump to face them,\" she mused. From a sturdy pumpkin shell and some strong wood, she meticulously crafted a small, hollow drum. \"Hide inside this, my precious,\" she instructed, \"and roll yourself home. If any ask who is inside, simply reply with the song I will teach you, and none shall guess it is you.\"\nLambikin, tucked snugly inside the drum, began his rolling journey home. Down the dusty path he tumbled, bumpety-bump, bumpety-bump. Soon, he encountered the very first of his hopeful Predators, the fearsome Tiger, who called out, \"Little drum, little drum, have you seen a Wee wee Lambikin pass this way?\" From within, Lambikin sang out in a muffled, singsong voice, \"No, I haven't, I haven't, I'm a drum, a drum, a drum!\" The Tiger, puzzled but uninterested in a mere drum, let it roll by. The Vulture, too, and the Wolf, the Dog, and the Eagle all asked the same question and received the same deceptive song, allowing the drum to pass, none suspecting the plump cargo within.\nBut as the drum approached the banyan tree where he had first stopped, the clever Jackal sprang out. \"Little drum, little drum, have you seen a Wee wee Lambikin pass this way?\" he yelped. Lambikin, overconfident from his previous successes, sang his little song, \"No, I haven't, I haven't, I'm a drum, a drum, a drum!\" But the Jackal, with a sly tilt of his head, recognized the distinctive lilt in the voice, the very same voice that had promised him a fatter meal. \"Aha!\" he snarled, a triumphant glint in his eyes. \"That's no drum! That's my Wee wee Lambikin, grown fat and juicy!\"\nWith a ferocious growl, the Jackal pounced upon the rolling drum. His sharp claws and teeth tore savagely at the pumpkin shell, ripping it to shreds in moments. Out tumbled the plump, round Lambikin, who barely had time to bleat in terror before the hungry Jackal seized him. The cunning Jackal, having patiently waited and outsmarted all the others, finally had his promised feast. And that, alas, was the end of the brave but ultimately outwitted Lambikin.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Jackal\"], \"receivers\": [\"Lambikin\"], \"new_characters\": [], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

One bright morning, bidding farewell to the familiar warmth of his pen and the gentle bleats of his mother, he decided it was time to trot along the dusty village path to her distant home. His tiny hooves skipped lightly over pebbles, his heart filled with innocent excitement for the journey ahead, unaware of the lurking dangers that often prowled beyond the secure fences of his family's farm.\nAs Wee wee Lambikin rounded a bend shaded by a gnarled banyan tree, a shadowy form emerged from the undergrowth. It was a lean, hungry Jackal, its eyes glinting with malicious intent. \"Aha!\" snarled the Jackal, blocking the path with its wiry body. \"What a plump little morsel you are! I haven't had such a delicious breakfast in ages. Prepare to be my meal, Wee wee Lambikin!\"\nWee wee Lambikin, though startled, quickly composed himself. \"Oh, most magnificent Jackal!\" he piped up, his voice trembling only slightly. \"Surely you wouldn't want to eat me now, when I am but a scrawny thing? I am on my way to my Granny's house, where she has a vast corn-bin. Let me go, eat my fill, and grow plump and juicy. Then, on my return, you may devour a much more satisfying feast!\" The Jackal, envisioning an even grander meal, licked its chops and, with a sly grin, agreed, \"Very well, little one. But remember your promise!\"\nFurther along the winding track, a colossal Vulture descended from the sky, casting an enormous shadow over Wee wee Lambikin. Its beady eyes, sharp as obsidian chips, fixed upon the small lamb. \"Little one,\" rasped the Vulture, its voice like dry leaves scraping, \"you look rather tender. You would make a delightful mid-morning snack.\" Undeterred, Wee wee Lambikin repeated his plea, \"Honored Vulture, I am but a lean morsel now. Permit me to reach my Granny's, where her corn-bin awaits. I promise to return a much fatter, more succulent feast for your aerial majesty.\" The Vulture, always one for a better prospect, tilted its bald head thoughtfully and croaked its assent, allowing the Lambikin to pass.\nWee wee Lambikin continued his journey, encountering a succession of hungry creatures.
