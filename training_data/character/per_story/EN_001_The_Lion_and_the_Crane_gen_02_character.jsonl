He spoke of an incarnation as a magnificent White Crane, known for his keen intellect and boundless compassion, who resided gracefully by a tranquil lotus pond, his pure white feathers gleaming under the benevolent Indian sun, always observing the intricate dance of life and karma unfolding around him.\nOne scorching afternoon, the serene jungle was shattered by agonized roars, unlike any sound of challenge or hunt. It was the fearsome Lion, known as Devadatta among the creatures, writhing in excruciating pain beneath a banyan tree. A jagged bone, sharp and stubborn, had become lodged deep within his throat, preventing him from swallowing even water, let alone the flesh of his prey. His mighty jaws were frozen in a grimace of agony, and starvation began to gnaw at the edges of his immense pride.\nThe White Crane, Bodhisatta, hearing the Lion’s desperate cries, approached with cautious compassion. Seeing the King of Beasts utterly helpless, he called out, \"O mighty Lion, I perceive your grave distress. I possess the skill to relieve you of this affliction, but I am a small bird, and you a formidable predator. I will help you, but only if you pledge, with the honor of your species, that you will not harm me once I have extracted the bone.\" The Lion, choking and desperate, managed a guttural assent, promising the Crane's safety with a barely perceptible nod.\nTrusting the Lion's desperate vow, yet wise to the inherent nature of predators, the Bodhisatta picked up a stout twig with his beak. With remarkable precision and unwavering courage, he inserted his long, slender beak into the gaping maw of the suffering Lion, deftly maneuvering past rows of terrifying fangs. Using the twig to brace the Lion's jaws open and applying a gentle but firm pressure, he skillfully dislodged the bone, which clattered to the earth, liberating the Lion from his torment. A wave of profound relief washed over the great beast.\nAs the Lion breathed deeply, savoring his newfound freedom from pain, the White Crane stepped back, a glimmer of expectation in his intelligent eyes. \"O King of the Jungle,\" he addressed the Lion, \"I have risked my life to save yours, facing your dreadful fangs and relying solely on your word. What recompense or token of gratitude do you, the most powerful of creatures, offer for this service?\" The Crane, in his wisdom, wished to test the Lion's character, not for personal gain, but to observe the true nature of his heart.\nThe Lion, now fully recovered and feeling his strength return, merely blinked his golden eyes at the small bird. A disdainful sneer curled his lip, replacing any hint of gratitude with arrogant contempt. \"Foolish bird!\" he growled, his voice now booming and menacing. \"Is it not payment enough that I, the mighty King of Beasts, who could have crushed you with a single snap of my jaws, allowed you to depart with your life? To have entered my mouth and emerged unscathed is a reward beyond measure for one such as you!\"\nThe White Crane, Bodhisatta, gazed steadily at the ungrateful Lion, his pure heart saddened but not surprised by the display of base ingratitude. \"You speak with the tongue of one who knows no righteousness, O Lion,\" he declared, his voice calm yet filled with the weight of truth. \"Your nature is indeed cruel and self-serving. One who repays kindness with threats will surely reap a bitter harvest in time.\" With these profound words, the wise Crane spread his majestic wings and soared gracefully into the sky, leaving the unrepentant Lion to ponder his own wretchedness, ensuring his own safety from such a treacherous heart.\nThen, Gautama the Buddha concluded his narrative, turning his benevolent gaze upon his rapt listeners. \"My disciples,\" he revealed, \"the wise White Crane of that ancient tale was none other than I, the Tathagata, in a former birth. And the ungrateful Lion, who embodied such malice and self-importance, was the very same Devadatta, who persists in his enmity towards me even in this present lifetime.

With remarkable precision and unwavering courage, he inserted his long, slender beak into the gaping maw of the suffering Lion, deftly maneuvering past rows of terrifying fangs. Using the twig to brace the Lion's jaws open and applying a gentle but firm pressure, he skillfully dislodged the bone, which clattered to the earth, liberating the Lion from his torment. A wave of profound relief washed over the great beast.\nAs the Lion breathed deeply, savoring his newfound freedom from pain, the White Crane stepped back, a glimmer of expectation in his intelligent eyes. \"O King of the Jungle,\" he addressed the Lion, \"I have risked my life to save yours, facing your dreadful fangs and relying solely on your word. What recompense or token of gratitude do you, the most powerful of creatures, offer for this service?\" The Crane, in his wisdom, wished to test the Lion's character, not for personal gain, but to observe the true nature of his heart.\nThe Lion, now fully recovered and feeling his strength return, merely blinked his golden eyes at the small bird. A disdainful sneer curled his lip, replacing any hint of gratitude with arrogant contempt. \"Foolish bird!\" he growled, his voice now booming and menacing. \"Is it not payment enough that I, the mighty King of Beasts, who could have crushed you with a single snap of my jaws, allowed you to depart with your life? To have entered my mouth and emerged unscathed is a reward beyond measure for one such as you!\"\nThe White Crane, Bodhisatta, gazed steadily at the ungrateful Lion, his pure heart saddened but not surprised by the display of base ingratitude. \"You speak with the tongue of one who knows no righteousness, O Lion,\" he declared, his voice calm yet filled with the weight of truth. \"Your nature is indeed cruel and self-serving. One who repays kindness with threats will surely reap a bitter harvest in time.\" With these profound words, the wise Crane spread his majestic wings and soared gracefully into the sky, leaving the unrepentant Lion to ponder his own wretchedness, ensuring his own safety from such a treacherous heart.\nThen, Gautama the Buddha concluded his narrative, turning his benevolent gaze upon his rapt listeners. \"My disciples,\" he revealed, \"the wise White Crane of that ancient tale was none other than I, the Tathagata, in a former birth. And the ungrateful Lion, who embodied such malice and self-importance, was the very same Devadatta, who persists in his enmity towards me even in this present lifetime.

It was the fearsome Lion, known as Devadatta among the creatures, writhing in excruciating pain beneath a banyan tree. A jagged bone, sharp and stubborn, had become lodged deep within his throat, preventing him from swallowing even water, let alone the flesh of his prey. His mighty jaws were frozen in a grimace of agony, and starvation began to gnaw at the edges of his immense pride.\nThe White Crane, Bodhisatta, hearing the Lion’s desperate cries, approached with cautious compassion. Seeing the King of Beasts utterly helpless, he called out, \"O mighty Lion, I perceive your grave distress. I possess the skill to relieve you of this affliction, but I am a small bird, and you a formidable predator. I will help you, but only if you pledge, with the honor of your species, that you will not harm me once I have extracted the bone.\" The Lion, choking and desperate, managed a guttural assent, promising the Crane's safety with a barely perceptible nod.\nTrusting the Lion's desperate vow, yet wise to the inherent nature of predators, the Bodhisatta picked up a stout twig with his beak.
