His heart, light as a feather, skipped with anticipation, and with a cheerful bleat and a hopeful wag of his tail, he set off on his adventure, convinced that Granny's warm embrace and delicious treats awaited him.\nHe had not gone very far when, from behind a thicket of thorny bushes, a gaunt and sly Jackal sprang forth, blocking his path. With a hungry glint in his yellow eyes and a menacing snarl, the Jackal declared, \"Ho, little Lambikin! What a tender morsel you are! I haven't had a good meal in days, and now you have come right to me. I shall eat you up this instant!\"\nBut Wee wee Lambikin, though startled, was quick-witted. He looked up at the fearsome creature and piped in a small but steady voice, \"Oh, good Jackal, please do not eat me now! I am thin and scrawny from my travels. Let me first go to my Granny's house, where I will eat fresh grains and sweet clover until I am plump and round. Then, on my way back, you may feast upon me as much as you wish!\" The Jackal, envisioning a much fatter meal, grumbled but agreed, letting the clever Lambikin pass.\nA little further on, as Lambikin made his way along a narrow track, a giant Vulture with keen, predatory eyes swooped down from the sky, casting a dark shadow over the little lamb. \"Squawk! A delicious treat awaits!\" shrieked the Vulture, spreading its immense wings. \"I shall pick your bones clean, little one!\" With the same cleverness, Lambikin pleaded, \"Wait, great Vulture! I am but skin and bone now. Let me go to my Granny's, become fat and juicy, and then you may have a truly satisfying meal.\" The Vulture, swayed by the promise of a grander feast, reluctantly agreed, watching Lambikin continue his journey.\nWee wee Lambikin encountered many more hungry creatures on his journey: a striped Tiger lurking by the river, a grey Wolf padding silently through the trees, a snarling Dog guarding a farmer's path, and even a sharp-eyed Eagle perched high on a crag. To each and every one, he repeated his clever plea, promising to return fatter and more delicious after his stay with Granny. And to each and every one, his promise of a future, more abundant meal proved irresistible, allowing the little Lambikin to continue his journey unharmed.\nAt last, Wee wee Lambikin arrived at his Granny's humble cottage, a haven of warmth and love. Granny, overjoyed to see her little one, took him in, showering him with affection. For days, Lambikin feasted on the choicest rice and lentils, sweet milk, and a special corn-bin filled to the brim with golden grains. He ate and ate until he was no longer a Wee wee Lambikin, but a truly plump, round, and juicy Lambikin, his sides bursting with health.\nAs the time for his return drew near, Granny, wise and ever-protective, knew the dangers that awaited her grandson. \"Those hungry creatures will be waiting for you, my dear,\" she said. With skilled hands, she took a large, hollow gourd, lined it with strong hide, and fashioned it into a sturdy, rolling drum. \"Hide inside this, my precious,\" she instructed, \"and roll yourself home. If any ask who passes, you must sing a song I will teach you.\"\nSo, tucked safely inside the drum, Lambikin began his journey home, rolling merrily down the winding path. As he trundled along, the Tiger, the Wolf, the Dog, the Eagle, and the Vulture, hearing the rolling sound, each in their turn called out, \"Drum, drum, who rolls there?\" And from within the drum, Wee wee Lambikin sang in a high, disguised voice: \"It's a drum, a drum, and no Lambikin, / Fat and round, on my way to my kin!\" The predators, confused by the strange song and the rolling drum, let it pass, none the wiser.\nBut when the drum reached the very spot where the cunning Jackal lay in wait, he pricked up his sharp ears. The song rang out, \"It's a drum, a drum, and no Lambikin, / Fat and round, on my way to my kin!\" The other animals might have been fooled, but the Jackal's sly mind worked differently. He listened closely to the lilt of the voice, and a flicker of recognition passed through his keen eyes. \"No Lambikin?\" he snarled to himself. \"That voice sounds very much like the Lambikin I let go!\"\nWithout another thought, the Jackal pounced upon the rolling drum, claws tearing at its strong hide. The drum shattered into pieces, and out tumbled the now plump and helpless Lambikin. Before the poor little creature could even let out a single bleat of alarm, the cunning Jackal seized him. And that, alas, was the end of Wee wee Lambikin, for the Jackal, finally having his patience rewarded, devoured the protagonist in one gulp, leaving not a trace.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Lambikin\"], \"receivers\": [\"self\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"Lambikin\", \"alias\": \"Wee wee Lambikin\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"}, {\"name\": \"self\", \"alias\": \"Lambikin\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

His heart, light as a feather, skipped with anticipation, and with a cheerful bleat and a hopeful wag of his tail, he set off on his adventure, convinced that Granny's warm embrace and delicious treats awaited him.\nHe had not gone very far when, from behind a thicket of thorny bushes, a gaunt and sly Jackal sprang forth, blocking his path. With a hungry glint in his yellow eyes and a menacing snarl, the Jackal declared, \"Ho, little Lambikin! What a tender morsel you are! I haven't had a good meal in days, and now you have come right to me. I shall eat you up this instant!\"\nBut Wee wee Lambikin, though startled, was quick-witted. He looked up at the fearsome creature and piped in a small but steady voice, \"Oh, good Jackal, please do not eat me now! I am thin and scrawny from my travels. Let me first go to my Granny's house, where I will eat fresh grains and sweet clover until I am plump and round. Then, on my way back, you may feast upon me as much as you wish!\" The Jackal, envisioning a much fatter meal, grumbled but agreed, letting the clever Lambikin pass.\nA little further on, as Lambikin made his way along a narrow track, a giant Vulture with keen, predatory eyes swooped down from the sky, casting a dark shadow over the little lamb. \"Squawk! A delicious treat awaits!\" shrieked the Vulture, spreading its immense wings. \"I shall pick your bones clean, little one!\" With the same cleverness, Lambikin pleaded, \"Wait, great Vulture! I am but skin and bone now. Let me go to my Granny's, become fat and juicy, and then you may have a truly satisfying meal.\" The Vulture, swayed by the promise of a grander feast, reluctantly agreed, watching Lambikin continue his journey.\nWee wee Lambikin encountered many more hungry creatures on his journey: a striped Tiger lurking by the river, a grey Wolf padding silently through the trees, a snarling Dog guarding a farmer's path, and even a sharp-eyed Eagle perched high on a crag. To each and every one, he repeated his clever plea, promising to return fatter and more delicious after his stay with Granny. And to each and every one, his promise of a future, more abundant meal proved irresistible, allowing the little Lambikin to continue his journey unharmed.\nAt last, Wee wee Lambikin arrived at his Granny's humble cottage, a haven of warmth and love.

He ate and ate until he was no longer a Wee wee Lambikin, but a truly plump, round, and juicy Lambikin, his sides bursting with health.\nAs the time for his return drew near, Granny, wise and ever-protective, knew the dangers that awaited her grandson. \"Those hungry creatures will be waiting for you, my dear,\" she said. With skilled hands, she took a large, hollow gourd, lined it with strong hide, and fashioned it into a sturdy, rolling drum. \"Hide inside this, my precious,\" she instructed, \"and roll yourself home. If any ask who passes, you must sing a song I will teach you.\"\nSo, tucked safely inside the drum, Lambikin began his journey home, rolling merrily down the winding path.

Let me go to my Granny's, become fat and juicy, and then you may have a truly satisfying meal.\" The Vulture, swayed by the promise of a grander feast, reluctantly agreed, watching Lambikin continue his journey.\nWee wee Lambikin encountered many more hungry creatures on his journey: a striped Tiger lurking by the river, a grey Wolf padding silently through the trees, a snarling Dog guarding a farmer's path, and even a sharp-eyed Eagle perched high on a crag. To each and every one, he repeated his clever plea, promising to return fatter and more delicious after his stay with Granny. And to each and every one, his promise of a future, more abundant meal proved irresistible, allowing the little Lambikin to continue his journey unharmed.\nAt last, Wee wee Lambikin arrived at his Granny's humble cottage, a haven of warmth and love. Granny, overjoyed to see her little one, took him in, showering him with affection. For days, Lambikin feasted on the choicest rice and lentils, sweet milk, and a special corn-bin filled to the brim with golden grains. He ate and ate until he was no longer a Wee wee Lambikin, but a truly plump, round, and juicy Lambikin, his sides bursting with health.\nAs the time for his return drew near, Granny, wise and ever-protective, knew the dangers that awaited her grandson. \"Those hungry creatures will be waiting for you, my dear,\" she said. With skilled hands, she took a large, hollow gourd, lined it with strong hide, and fashioned it into a sturdy, rolling drum. \"Hide inside this, my precious,\" she instructed, \"and roll yourself home. If any ask who passes, you must sing a song I will teach you.\"\nSo, tucked safely inside the drum, Lambikin began his journey home, rolling merrily down the winding path. As he trundled along, the Tiger, the Wolf, the Dog, the Eagle, and the Vulture, hearing the rolling sound, each in their turn called out, \"Drum, drum, who rolls there?\" And from within the drum, Wee wee Lambikin sang in a high, disguised voice: \"It's a drum, a drum, and no Lambikin, / Fat and round, on my way to my kin!\" The predators, confused by the strange song and the rolling drum, let it pass, none the wiser.\nBut when the drum reached the very spot where the cunning Jackal lay in wait, he pricked up his sharp ears. The song rang out, \"It's a drum, a drum, and no Lambikin, / Fat and round, on my way to my kin!\" The other animals might have been fooled, but the Jackal's sly mind worked differently. He listened closely to the lilt of the voice, and a flicker of recognition passed through his keen eyes. \"No Lambikin?\" he snarled to himself. \"That voice sounds very much like the Lambikin I let go!\"\nWithout another thought, the Jackal pounced upon the rolling drum, claws tearing at its strong hide. The drum shattered into pieces, and out tumbled the now plump and helpless Lambikin. Before the poor little creature could even let out a single bleat of alarm, the cunning Jackal seized him. And that, alas, was the end of Wee wee Lambikin, for the Jackal, finally having his patience rewarded, devoured the protagonist in one gulp, leaving not a trace.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Jackal\"], \"receivers\": [\"lalb\"], \"new_characters\": [], \"notes\": \"\"}"}
