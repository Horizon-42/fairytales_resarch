His fields yielded barely enough to feed his family, while the village's infamous Money-lender, a stout and cruel man named Sethji, grew fatter and richer each day, his mansion a testament to his exorbitant interest rates. One sweltering afternoon, driven by desperation, The Farmer approached Sethji, bowing low. \"Master,\" he pleaded, his voice thick with humility, \"you possess the secret to immense wealth. Please, in your great generosity, share with this poor man how one might find such fortune.\" The Money-lender, sneering at the Farmer's ragged attire, chuckled cruelly. \"Wealth, simpleton? It comes from seeking Ram, the ultimate giver! Now begone, lest you soil my doorstep with your poverty.\"\n\nSummary:\nIn a village plagued by poverty, a hardworking farmer seeks wealth from a cruel money-lender, only to be directed to find the deity Ram.

His mind, unburdened by cynicism, believed that Ram, the benevolent Lord, truly held the key to prosperity.

He traversed sun-baked plains and climbed rocky hills, asking every traveler for directions to the abode of Ram. Finally, deep within a serene forest, he came upon a small, ancient ashram where a kindly old hermit sat in deep meditation. The Farmer, seeing the hermit’s peaceful countenance, felt a reverence wash over him. Without a word, he began to help the hermit with his chores, fetching water from the river, sweeping the ashram floor, and tending to the small garden, never once asking for anything in return, simply offering his tireless service out of devotion and hope.\n\nSummary:\nIn a village plagued by poverty, a hardworking farmer seeks wealth from a cruel money-lender, only to be directed to find the deity Ram.
