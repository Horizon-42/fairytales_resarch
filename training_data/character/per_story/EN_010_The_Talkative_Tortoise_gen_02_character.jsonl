His court often stretched late into the night, not due to complex affairs of state, but because the King would hold forth on every conceivable subject, leaving his ministers exhausted and pressing matters delayed. The King's Adviser, a revered sage known as The Future Buddha, observed this with quiet concern, recognizing that this garrulous habit, though seemingly harmless, was a significant impediment to true wisdom and efficient governance. He resolved to find a way to gently guide the King towards a more balanced demeanor.\n\nSummary:\nIn the ancient kingdom of Varanasi, King Brahma-datta's endless speech hindered governance, prompting his adviser, the Future Buddha, to use a parable about a talkative tortoise carried by Hamsas. The Tortoise, warned to stay silent, faltered under villagers' mockery and fell to his death, teaching the king the dangers of uncontrolled speech. Inspired by the tale, the king embraced measured words, transforming into a wise ruler.

They devised a clever plan: Friend Tortoise would clamp firmly onto the middle of a strong stick with his mouth, and each Wild Duck would grasp an end, thus carrying him aloft.
