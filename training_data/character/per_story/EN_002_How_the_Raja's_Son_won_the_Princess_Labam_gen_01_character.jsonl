There lie dangers and distractions that would turn your heart from your duties and bring sorrow upon our house.\" The Young Prince, ever dutiful, nodded, though a spark of untamed curiosity flickered in his youthful eyes.\n\nSummary:\n\n\n\n\nFull Story Context:\nIn the opulent palace, the wise Rani, mother to the young Raja's Son, sat him down with a solemn expression. \"My son,\" she began, \"you may hunt in the eastern forests, the western groves, and the southern plains, but never, under any circumstance, venture to the fourth side, the lands beyond the northern mountains. There lie dangers and distractions that would turn your heart from your duties and bring sorrow upon our house.\" The Young Prince, ever dutiful, nodded, though a spark of untamed curiosity flickered in his youthful eyes.\nFor many moons, the Young Prince honored his mother's interdiction, but the lure of the unknown proved too strong for his adventurous spirit. One scorching afternoon, feigning a chase after a phantom deer, he led his retinue to the foothills of the northern mountains. Dismissing his companions, he slipped into the forbidden territory, where the verdant forest seemed to hum with an ancient magic. There, perched regally upon a giant banyan tree, he encountered the magnificent Hiraman Parrot, its plumage a kaleidoscope of jewels, its eyes wise and knowing.\nThe Hiraman Parrot, observing the Raja's Son's awe, spoke in a voice like tinkling bells, \"Young Prince, your mother forbids this land because it holds a secret more precious than gold: Princess Labam, whose beauty outshines the moon, whose grace flows like a mountain stream, and whose wisdom rivals that of ancient sages. She resides in the palace beyond these peaks, and no mortal man has ever gazed upon her without falling instantly and hopelessly in love.\" The parrot's words painted a vivid image in the Young Prince's mind, igniting an unquenchable flame of desire for Princess Labam.\nConsumed by his newfound yearning, the Raja's Son returned to his parents and, with a heart full of conviction, declared his intention to journey to the kingdom of Princess Labam. His parents, initially heartbroken and apprehensive, tried to dissuade him, reminding him of the dangers and the Rani's earlier warning. But seeing the unwavering resolve in his eyes, they eventually relented, blessing his quest and providing him with the finest steeds, ample provisions, and a pouch of shimmering gold coins for his epic journey.\nAs the Young Prince traveled through sun-drenched plains, he stumbled upon a long procession of tiny ants, struggling valiantly to carry grains of rice many times their size across his path. Instead of trampling them or dismissing their efforts, he dismounted, carefully cleared a wide, smooth path for them, and even scattered a few extra grains of rice from his own provisions. Suddenly, the Ant-Raja, distinguishable by his slightly larger size and regal bearing, emerged, bowing deeply. \"Noble Prince,\" he chirped, \"you have shown kindness to my people. Should you ever need assistance, remember the Ant-Raja, and we shall come to your aid.\"\nFurther on, deep within a dense jungle, the Raja's Son heard the piteous roars of a mighty Tiger, trapped in a hunter's snare. Despite the inherent danger, the Young Prince, remembering his own yearning heart, approached the thrashing beast with compassion. With great effort and courage, he painstakingly untangled the thick ropes, freeing the magnificent creature. The Tiger, momentarily subdued by pain, licked the prince's hand in gratitude. \"My Prince,\" it rumbled, its voice deep and resonant, \"you have saved my life. Whenever you face insurmountable odds, call upon me, and I shall come like the wind to serve you.\"\nContinuing his journey, the Young Prince encountered four quarrelsome Fakirs, squabbling bitterly over their magical possessions: a flying bed, an inexhaustible bag of food, a bowl that produced any desired drink, and a magic stick that could create a strong rope from thin air. Cleverly, the Prince proposed a contest: whoever could climb the tallest tree and touch the sky first would claim all the items. As the foolish Fakirs exhausted themselves in futile attempts, the Raja's Son, with nimble fingers and a silent prayer, deftly collected all four unattended magical objects, securing powerful tools for his quest.\nFinally arriving at the outskirts of Princess Labam's kingdom, the Young Prince, wisely choosing to maintain his anonymity, sought shelter in a small, humble hut. There lived an old woman, with kindly eyes and a weary frame. Approaching her with respect and feigning distress, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, lost in his travels. The Old Woman, her heart touched by his polite demeanor and plausible tale, welcomed him warmly, offering him food and a place to rest, unaware of his true identity or the grand purpose of his stealthy arrival.\nUnder the cloak of the new moon, using the magic bed to navigate unseen, the Raja's Son floated silently into the Princess's bejeweled chambers. Princess Labam lay asleep, a vision of ethereal beauty, just as the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a long moment, his heart swelling with reverence, before quietly placing a meticulously folded betel-leaf, fragrant and auspicious, beside her silken pillow. It was a silent, traditional token of admiration, a hint of his presence, leaving her to ponder the mysterious gift upon waking.\nSeveral nights later, emboldened by the Princess's apparent acceptance of the previous gift—for the betel-leaf had vanished by morning—the Young Prince returned to her sleeping chambers. This time, he decided on a more significant offering, a shimmering shawl woven from the finest silk, adorned with intricate gold embroidery. He draped it carefully over her delicate form, once again silently observing her serene beauty before departing as stealthily as he had arrived, leaving behind another undeniable mark of his unseen presence.\nOn his next visit, as Princess Labam awoke and discovered him in her chamber, her initial alarm quickly turned to a flush of recognition. Having found the betel-leaf and the shawl, her heart had already begun to weave tales of a secret admirer, and his appearance only confirmed her unspoken hopes. With a gentle voice, the Raja's Son revealed his identity and the arduous journey he had undertaken for her. Princess Labam, touched by his courage and unwavering devotion, acknowledged her own stirring affection and, with a shy smile, accepted his proposal of marriage.\nWhen the news of their secret betrothal reached the King, Princess Labam's father, his rage was immense. He was a proud and arrogant ruler, and this unknown prince was an insult to his royal lineage. Determined to be rid of this unwelcome suitor, the King devised a seemingly impossible test: the Raja's Son was commanded to crush oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds, a task that would take hundreds of laborers weeks to complete, and he was given but a single day to finish it, or forfeit his life.\nAs the sun began its descent, casting long shadows over the insurmountable pile of mustard seeds, the Raja's Son remembered the promise of the Ant-Raja. With a desperate plea, he called out. Suddenly, from every crevice and crack, millions upon millions of tiny ants emerged, a living, moving carpet. The Ant-Raja led them, and with unparalleled coordination and tireless effort, they meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting a river of oil by dawn. The King awoke to find the impossible task miraculously completed, leaving him speechless.\nFurious at the Prince’s success, the King immediately concocted an even deadlier trial. He declared that two monstrous demons, known for their insatiable hunger and terrifying strength, had been terrorizing the distant villages, and commanded the Raja's Son to slay them before the next full moon. This task was designed to be his doom, for these demons had already claimed the lives of countless brave warriors, and their lair was said to be impregnable.\nWith courage born of desperation, the Raja's Son ventured towards the demons' infamous lair, calling upon the Tiger he had once saved. True to its word, the magnificent Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. With a primal roar that shook the earth, the powerful beast sprang into action, confronting the monstrous demons. Its unparalleled ferocity and cunning made quick work of the fearsome creatures, leaving them vanquished and the surrounding lands safe once more, fulfilling its sacred vow to the astonished Prince.\nStill unwilling to accept the Young Prince as his son-in-law, the King presented a third impossible challenge. He pointed to a giant kettle_drum, suspended impossibly high in the vast, empty sky, a symbol of royal power that had remained untouched for centuries. \"Beat that drum,\" the King boomed, \"and let its thunder echo through the heavens! Only then will I consider you worthy of my daughter!\" The entire court gasped, for no ladder could reach, and no human could leap so high.\nWithout a moment's hesitation, the Raja's Son brought forth the magic bed he had acquired from the quarreling Fakirs. With a quiet command, the enchanted bed lifted him effortlessly into the azure sky, soaring higher and higher until he reached the suspended kettle_drum. With a mighty flourish, he struck the massive instrument, and its resounding boom echoed across the entire kingdom, a sound that filled the hearts of the people with wonder and hope, and the King with seething frustration.\nIn a final, desperate attempt to rid himself of the persistent suitor, the King presented what he believed to be the ultimate, foolproof impossibility. He led the Raja's Son to an ancient, colossal Banyan tree, its branches reaching like gnarled arms into the heavens. \"Cut down this tree,\" the King declared, \"but you must use this!\" He handed the Prince a fragile hatchet made entirely of soft, pliable wax. The King watched with a cruel smirk, certain that this time, his rival would surely fail.\nAs the Prince stood before the mighty tree, a sense of despair crept in, the wax hatchet melting in his hand under the warm sun. But then, Princess Labam, who had been secretly observing, stepped forward. With a knowing glance and a whispered word of encouragement, she plucked a single strand of hair from her head, radiant with an inner magic, and pressed it into his hand. \"Use this, my love,\" she urged. To the astonishment of all, the magic hair, sharper than any blade, sliced through the colossal tree as if it were mere butter, felling it in a single, effortless stroke.\nHaving passed all the King's impossible tests with the aid of his allies and the ingenuity of Princess Labam, the Raja's Son finally married his beloved Princess in a magnificent ceremony that lasted for seven days and seven nights. Their union was celebrated with joyous feasts and grand festivities throughout the land. With his beautiful bride by his side, the victorious Young Prince then returned to his own kingdom, where he was welcomed with immense pride by his parents, ready to rule wisely and justly, forever remembering the courage and kindness that had won him Princess Labam.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Rani\"], \"receivers\": [\"Raja's Son\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"Raja's Son\", \"alias\": \"The Young Prince\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"}, {\"name\": \"Rani\", \"alias\": \"Mother\", \"archetype\": \"Mother\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

He led the Raja's Son to an ancient, colossal Banyan tree, its branches reaching like gnarled arms into the heavens. \"Cut down this tree,\" the King declared, \"but you must use this!\" He handed the Prince a fragile hatchet made entirely of soft, pliable wax. The King watched with a cruel smirk, certain that this time, his rival would surely fail.\nAs the Prince stood before the mighty tree, a sense of despair crept in, the wax hatchet melting in his hand under the warm sun. But then, Princess Labam, who had been secretly observing, stepped forward. With a knowing glance and a whispered word of encouragement, she plucked a single strand of hair from her head, radiant with an inner magic, and pressed it into his hand. \"Use this, my love,\" she urged. To the astonishment of all, the magic hair, sharper than any blade, sliced through the colossal tree as if it were mere butter, felling it in a single, effortless stroke.\nHaving passed all the King's impossible tests with the aid of his allies and the ingenuity of Princess Labam, the Raja's Son finally married his beloved Princess in a magnificent ceremony that lasted for seven days and seven nights. Their union was celebrated with joyous feasts and grand festivities throughout the land. With his beautiful bride by his side, the victorious Young Prince then returned to his own kingdom, where he was welcomed with immense pride by his parents, ready to rule wisely and justly, forever remembering the courage and kindness that had won him Princess Labam.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Hiraman Parrot\"], \"receivers\": [\"Raja's Son\"], \"new_characters\": [], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

His parents, initially heartbroken and apprehensive, tried to dissuade him, reminding him of the dangers and the Rani's earlier warning.

There lie dangers and distractions that would turn your heart from your duties and bring sorrow upon our house.\" The Young Prince, ever dutiful, nodded, though a spark of untamed curiosity flickered in his youthful eyes.\nFor many moons, the Young Prince honored his mother's interdiction, but the lure of the unknown proved too strong for his adventurous spirit. One scorching afternoon, feigning a chase after a phantom deer, he led his retinue to the foothills of the northern mountains. Dismissing his companions, he slipped into the forbidden territory, where the verdant forest seemed to hum with an ancient magic. There, perched regally upon a giant banyan tree, he encountered the magnificent Hiraman Parrot, its plumage a kaleidoscope of jewels, its eyes wise and knowing.\nThe Hiraman Parrot, observing the Raja's Son's awe, spoke in a voice like tinkling bells, \"Young Prince, your mother forbids this land because it holds a secret more precious than gold: Princess Labam, whose beauty outshines the moon, whose grace flows like a mountain stream, and whose wisdom rivals that of ancient sages. She resides in the palace beyond these peaks, and no mortal man has ever gazed upon her without falling instantly and hopelessly in love.\" The parrot's words painted a vivid image in the Young Prince's mind, igniting an unquenchable flame of desire for Princess Labam.\nConsumed by his newfound yearning, the Raja's Son returned to his parents and, with a heart full of conviction, declared his intention to journey to the kingdom of Princess Labam. His parents, initially heartbroken and apprehensive, tried to dissuade him, reminding him of the dangers and the Rani's earlier warning. But seeing the unwavering resolve in his eyes, they eventually relented, blessing his quest and providing him with the finest steeds, ample provisions, and a pouch of shimmering gold coins for his epic journey.\nAs the Young Prince traveled through sun-drenched plains, he stumbled upon a long procession of tiny ants, struggling valiantly to carry grains of rice many times their size across his path. Instead of trampling them or dismissing their efforts, he dismounted, carefully cleared a wide, smooth path for them, and even scattered a few extra grains of rice from his own provisions. Suddenly, the Ant-Raja, distinguishable by his slightly larger size and regal bearing, emerged, bowing deeply. \"Noble Prince,\" he chirped, \"you have shown kindness to my people. Should you ever need assistance, remember the Ant-Raja, and we shall come to your aid.\"\nFurther on, deep within a dense jungle, the Raja's Son heard the piteous roars of a mighty Tiger, trapped in a hunter's snare. Despite the inherent danger, the Young Prince, remembering his own yearning heart, approached the thrashing beast with compassion. With great effort and courage, he painstakingly untangled the thick ropes, freeing the magnificent creature. The Tiger, momentarily subdued by pain, licked the prince's hand in gratitude. \"My Prince,\" it rumbled, its voice deep and resonant, \"you have saved my life. Whenever you face insurmountable odds, call upon me, and I shall come like the wind to serve you.\"\nContinuing his journey, the Young Prince encountered four quarrelsome Fakirs, squabbling bitterly over their magical possessions: a flying bed, an inexhaustible bag of food, a bowl that produced any desired drink, and a magic stick that could create a strong rope from thin air. Cleverly, the Prince proposed a contest: whoever could climb the tallest tree and touch the sky first would claim all the items. As the foolish Fakirs exhausted themselves in futile attempts, the Raja's Son, with nimble fingers and a silent prayer, deftly collected all four unattended magical objects, securing powerful tools for his quest.\nFinally arriving at the outskirts of Princess Labam's kingdom, the Young Prince, wisely choosing to maintain his anonymity, sought shelter in a small, humble hut. There lived an old woman, with kindly eyes and a weary frame. Approaching her with respect and feigning distress, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, lost in his travels. The Old Woman, her heart touched by his polite demeanor and plausible tale, welcomed him warmly, offering him food and a place to rest, unaware of his true identity or the grand purpose of his stealthy arrival.\nUnder the cloak of the new moon, using the magic bed to navigate unseen, the Raja's Son floated silently into the Princess's bejeweled chambers. Princess Labam lay asleep, a vision of ethereal beauty, just as the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a long moment, his heart swelling with reverence, before quietly placing a meticulously folded betel-leaf, fragrant and auspicious, beside her silken pillow. It was a silent, traditional token of admiration, a hint of his presence, leaving her to ponder the mysterious gift upon waking.\nSeveral nights later, emboldened by the Princess's apparent acceptance of the previous gift—for the betel-leaf had vanished by morning—the Young Prince returned to her sleeping chambers. This time, he decided on a more significant offering, a shimmering shawl woven from the finest silk, adorned with intricate gold embroidery. He draped it carefully over her delicate form, once again silently observing her serene beauty before departing as stealthily as he had arrived, leaving behind another undeniable mark of his unseen presence.\nOn his next visit, as Princess Labam awoke and discovered him in her chamber, her initial alarm quickly turned to a flush of recognition. Having found the betel-leaf and the shawl, her heart had already begun to weave tales of a secret admirer, and his appearance only confirmed her unspoken hopes. With a gentle voice, the Raja's Son revealed his identity and the arduous journey he had undertaken for her. Princess Labam, touched by his courage and unwavering devotion, acknowledged her own stirring affection and, with a shy smile, accepted his proposal of marriage.\nWhen the news of their secret betrothal reached the King, Princess Labam's father, his rage was immense. He was a proud and arrogant ruler, and this unknown prince was an insult to his royal lineage. Determined to be rid of this unwelcome suitor, the King devised a seemingly impossible test: the Raja's Son was commanded to crush oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds, a task that would take hundreds of laborers weeks to complete, and he was given but a single day to finish it, or forfeit his life.\nAs the sun began its descent, casting long shadows over the insurmountable pile of mustard seeds, the Raja's Son remembered the promise of the Ant-Raja. With a desperate plea, he called out. Suddenly, from every crevice and crack, millions upon millions of tiny ants emerged, a living, moving carpet. The Ant-Raja led them, and with unparalleled coordination and tireless effort, they meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting a river of oil by dawn. The King awoke to find the impossible task miraculously completed, leaving him speechless.\nFurious at the Prince’s success, the King immediately concocted an even deadlier trial. He declared that two monstrous demons, known for their insatiable hunger and terrifying strength, had been terrorizing the distant villages, and commanded the Raja's Son to slay them before the next full moon. This task was designed to be his doom, for these demons had already claimed the lives of countless brave warriors, and their lair was said to be impregnable.\nWith courage born of desperation, the Raja's Son ventured towards the demons' infamous lair, calling upon the Tiger he had once saved. True to its word, the magnificent Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. With a primal roar that shook the earth, the powerful beast sprang into action, confronting the monstrous demons. Its unparalleled ferocity and cunning made quick work of the fearsome creatures, leaving them vanquished and the surrounding lands safe once more, fulfilling its sacred vow to the astonished Prince.\nStill unwilling to accept the Young Prince as his son-in-law, the King presented a third impossible challenge. He pointed to a giant kettle_drum, suspended impossibly high in the vast, empty sky, a symbol of royal power that had remained untouched for centuries. \"Beat that drum,\" the King boomed, \"and let its thunder echo through the heavens! Only then will I consider you worthy of my daughter!\" The entire court gasped, for no ladder could reach, and no human could leap so high.\nWithout a moment's hesitation, the Raja's Son brought forth the magic bed he had acquired from the quarreling Fakirs. With a quiet command, the enchanted bed lifted him effortlessly into the azure sky, soaring higher and higher until he reached the suspended kettle_drum.

Princess Labam, touched by his courage and unwavering devotion, acknowledged her own stirring affection and, with a shy smile, accepted his proposal of marriage.\nWhen the news of their secret betrothal reached the King, Princess Labam's father, his rage was immense. He was a proud and arrogant ruler, and this unknown prince was an insult to his royal lineage. Determined to be rid of this unwelcome suitor, the King devised a seemingly impossible test: the Raja's Son was commanded to crush oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds, a task that would take hundreds of laborers weeks to complete, and he was given but a single day to finish it, or forfeit his life.\nAs the sun began its descent, casting long shadows over the insurmountable pile of mustard seeds, the Raja's Son remembered the promise of the Ant-Raja. With a desperate plea, he called out. Suddenly, from every crevice and crack, millions upon millions of tiny ants emerged, a living, moving carpet. The Ant-Raja led them, and with unparalleled coordination and tireless effort, they meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting a river of oil by dawn. The King awoke to find the impossible task miraculously completed, leaving him speechless.\nFurious at the Prince’s success, the King immediately concocted an even deadlier trial. He declared that two monstrous demons, known for their insatiable hunger and terrifying strength, had been terrorizing the distant villages, and commanded the Raja's Son to slay them before the next full moon. This task was designed to be his doom, for these demons had already claimed the lives of countless brave warriors, and their lair was said to be impregnable.\nWith courage born of desperation, the Raja's Son ventured towards the demons' infamous lair, calling upon the Tiger he had once saved. True to its word, the magnificent Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. With a primal roar that shook the earth, the powerful beast sprang into action, confronting the monstrous demons. Its unparalleled ferocity and cunning made quick work of the fearsome creatures, leaving them vanquished and the surrounding lands safe once more, fulfilling its sacred vow to the astonished Prince.\nStill unwilling to accept the Young Prince as his son-in-law, the King presented a third impossible challenge. He pointed to a giant kettle_drum, suspended impossibly high in the vast, empty sky, a symbol of royal power that had remained untouched for centuries. \"Beat that drum,\" the King boomed, \"and let its thunder echo through the heavens! Only then will I consider you worthy of my daughter!\" The entire court gasped, for no ladder could reach, and no human could leap so high.\nWithout a moment's hesitation, the Raja's Son brought forth the magic bed he had acquired from the quarreling Fakirs. With a quiet command, the enchanted bed lifted him effortlessly into the azure sky, soaring higher and higher until he reached the suspended kettle_drum. With a mighty flourish, he struck the massive instrument, and its resounding boom echoed across the entire kingdom, a sound that filled the hearts of the people with wonder and hope, and the King with seething frustration.\nIn a final, desperate attempt to rid himself of the persistent suitor, the King presented what he believed to be the ultimate, foolproof impossibility. He led the Raja's Son to an ancient, colossal Banyan tree, its branches reaching like gnarled arms into the heavens. \"Cut down this tree,\" the King declared, \"but you must use this!\" He handed the Prince a fragile hatchet made entirely of soft, pliable wax. The King watched with a cruel smirk, certain that this time, his rival would surely fail.\nAs the Prince stood before the mighty tree, a sense of despair crept in, the wax hatchet melting in his hand under the warm sun. But then, Princess Labam, who had been secretly observing, stepped forward. With a knowing glance and a whispered word of encouragement, she plucked a single strand of hair from her head, radiant with an inner magic, and pressed it into his hand. \"Use this, my love,\" she urged. To the astonishment of all, the magic hair, sharper than any blade, sliced through the colossal tree as if it were mere butter, felling it in a single, effortless stroke.\nHaving passed all the King's impossible tests with the aid of his allies and the ingenuity of Princess Labam, the Raja's Son finally married his beloved Princess in a magnificent ceremony that lasted for seven days and seven nights. Their union was celebrated with joyous feasts and grand festivities throughout the land. With his beautiful bride by his side, the victorious Young Prince then returned to his own kingdom, where he was welcomed with immense pride by his parents, ready to rule wisely and justly, forever remembering the courage and kindness that had won him Princess Labam.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Tiger\"], \"receivers\": [\"Raja's Son\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"Tiger\", \"alias\": \"\", \"archetype\": \"Other\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

There lie dangers and distractions that would turn your heart from your duties and bring sorrow upon our house.\" The Young Prince, ever dutiful, nodded, though a spark of untamed curiosity flickered in his youthful eyes.\nFor many moons, the Young Prince honored his mother's interdiction, but the lure of the unknown proved too strong for his adventurous spirit. One scorching afternoon, feigning a chase after a phantom deer, he led his retinue to the foothills of the northern mountains. Dismissing his companions, he slipped into the forbidden territory, where the verdant forest seemed to hum with an ancient magic. There, perched regally upon a giant banyan tree, he encountered the magnificent Hiraman Parrot, its plumage a kaleidoscope of jewels, its eyes wise and knowing.\nThe Hiraman Parrot, observing the Raja's Son's awe, spoke in a voice like tinkling bells, \"Young Prince, your mother forbids this land because it holds a secret more precious than gold: Princess Labam, whose beauty outshines the moon, whose grace flows like a mountain stream, and whose wisdom rivals that of ancient sages. She resides in the palace beyond these peaks, and no mortal man has ever gazed upon her without falling instantly and hopelessly in love.\" The parrot's words painted a vivid image in the Young Prince's mind, igniting an unquenchable flame of desire for Princess Labam.\nConsumed by his newfound yearning, the Raja's Son returned to his parents and, with a heart full of conviction, declared his intention to journey to the kingdom of Princess Labam. His parents, initially heartbroken and apprehensive, tried to dissuade him, reminding him of the dangers and the Rani's earlier warning. But seeing the unwavering resolve in his eyes, they eventually relented, blessing his quest and providing him with the finest steeds, ample provisions, and a pouch of shimmering gold coins for his epic journey.\nAs the Young Prince traveled through sun-drenched plains, he stumbled upon a long procession of tiny ants, struggling valiantly to carry grains of rice many times their size across his path. Instead of trampling them or dismissing their efforts, he dismounted, carefully cleared a wide, smooth path for them, and even scattered a few extra grains of rice from his own provisions. Suddenly, the Ant-Raja, distinguishable by his slightly larger size and regal bearing, emerged, bowing deeply. \"Noble Prince,\" he chirped, \"you have shown kindness to my people. Should you ever need assistance, remember the Ant-Raja, and we shall come to your aid.\"\nFurther on, deep within a dense jungle, the Raja's Son heard the piteous roars of a mighty Tiger, trapped in a hunter's snare. Despite the inherent danger, the Young Prince, remembering his own yearning heart, approached the thrashing beast with compassion. With great effort and courage, he painstakingly untangled the thick ropes, freeing the magnificent creature. The Tiger, momentarily subdued by pain, licked the prince's hand in gratitude. \"My Prince,\" it rumbled, its voice deep and resonant, \"you have saved my life. Whenever you face insurmountable odds, call upon me, and I shall come like the wind to serve you.\"\nContinuing his journey, the Young Prince encountered four quarrelsome Fakirs, squabbling bitterly over their magical possessions: a flying bed, an inexhaustible bag of food, a bowl that produced any desired drink, and a magic stick that could create a strong rope from thin air. Cleverly, the Prince proposed a contest: whoever could climb the tallest tree and touch the sky first would claim all the items. As the foolish Fakirs exhausted themselves in futile attempts, the Raja's Son, with nimble fingers and a silent prayer, deftly collected all four unattended magical objects, securing powerful tools for his quest.\nFinally arriving at the outskirts of Princess Labam's kingdom, the Young Prince, wisely choosing to maintain his anonymity, sought shelter in a small, humble hut. There lived an old woman, with kindly eyes and a weary frame. Approaching her with respect and feigning distress, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, lost in his travels. The Old Woman, her heart touched by his polite demeanor and plausible tale, welcomed him warmly, offering him food and a place to rest, unaware of his true identity or the grand purpose of his stealthy arrival.\nUnder the cloak of the new moon, using the magic bed to navigate unseen, the Raja's Son floated silently into the Princess's bejeweled chambers. Princess Labam lay asleep, a vision of ethereal beauty, just as the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a long moment, his heart swelling with reverence, before quietly placing a meticulously folded betel-leaf, fragrant and auspicious, beside her silken pillow. It was a silent, traditional token of admiration, a hint of his presence, leaving her to ponder the mysterious gift upon waking.\nSeveral nights later, emboldened by the Princess's apparent acceptance of the previous gift—for the betel-leaf had vanished by morning—the Young Prince returned to her sleeping chambers. This time, he decided on a more significant offering, a shimmering shawl woven from the finest silk, adorned with intricate gold embroidery. He draped it carefully over her delicate form, once again silently observing her serene beauty before departing as stealthily as he had arrived, leaving behind another undeniable mark of his unseen presence.\nOn his next visit, as Princess Labam awoke and discovered him in her chamber, her initial alarm quickly turned to a flush of recognition. Having found the betel-leaf and the shawl, her heart had already begun to weave tales of a secret admirer, and his appearance only confirmed her unspoken hopes.

Should you ever need assistance, remember the Ant-Raja, and we shall come to your aid.\"\nFurther on, deep within a dense jungle, the Raja's Son heard the piteous roars of a mighty Tiger, trapped in a hunter's snare. Despite the inherent danger, the Young Prince, remembering his own yearning heart, approached the thrashing beast with compassion. With great effort and courage, he painstakingly untangled the thick ropes, freeing the magnificent creature. The Tiger, momentarily subdued by pain, licked the prince's hand in gratitude. \"My Prince,\" it rumbled, its voice deep and resonant, \"you have saved my life. Whenever you face insurmountable odds, call upon me, and I shall come like the wind to serve you.\"\nContinuing his journey, the Young Prince encountered four quarrelsome Fakirs, squabbling bitterly over their magical possessions: a flying bed, an inexhaustible bag of food, a bowl that produced any desired drink, and a magic stick that could create a strong rope from thin air. Cleverly, the Prince proposed a contest: whoever could climb the tallest tree and touch the sky first would claim all the items. As the foolish Fakirs exhausted themselves in futile attempts, the Raja's Son, with nimble fingers and a silent prayer, deftly collected all four unattended magical objects, securing powerful tools for his quest.\nFinally arriving at the outskirts of Princess Labam's kingdom, the Young Prince, wisely choosing to maintain his anonymity, sought shelter in a small, humble hut. There lived an old woman, with kindly eyes and a weary frame. Approaching her with respect and feigning distress, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, lost in his travels. The Old Woman, her heart touched by his polite demeanor and plausible tale, welcomed him warmly, offering him food and a place to rest, unaware of his true identity or the grand purpose of his stealthy arrival.\nUnder the cloak of the new moon, using the magic bed to navigate unseen, the Raja's Son floated silently into the Princess's bejeweled chambers. Princess Labam lay asleep, a vision of ethereal beauty, just as the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a long moment, his heart swelling with reverence, before quietly placing a meticulously folded betel-leaf, fragrant and auspicious, beside her silken pillow. It was a silent, traditional token of admiration, a hint of his presence, leaving her to ponder the mysterious gift upon waking.\nSeveral nights later, emboldened by the Princess's apparent acceptance of the previous gift—for the betel-leaf had vanished by morning—the Young Prince returned to her sleeping chambers. This time, he decided on a more significant offering, a shimmering shawl woven from the finest silk, adorned with intricate gold embroidery. He draped it carefully over her delicate form, once again silently observing her serene beauty before departing as stealthily as he had arrived, leaving behind another undeniable mark of his unseen presence.\nOn his next visit, as Princess Labam awoke and discovered him in her chamber, her initial alarm quickly turned to a flush of recognition. Having found the betel-leaf and the shawl, her heart had already begun to weave tales of a secret admirer, and his appearance only confirmed her unspoken hopes. With a gentle voice, the Raja's Son revealed his identity and the arduous journey he had undertaken for her. Princess Labam, touched by his courage and unwavering devotion, acknowledged her own stirring affection and, with a shy smile, accepted his proposal of marriage.\nWhen the news of their secret betrothal reached the King, Princess Labam's father, his rage was immense. He was a proud and arrogant ruler, and this unknown prince was an insult to his royal lineage. Determined to be rid of this unwelcome suitor, the King devised a seemingly impossible test: the Raja's Son was commanded to crush oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds, a task that would take hundreds of laborers weeks to complete, and he was given but a single day to finish it, or forfeit his life.\nAs the sun began its descent, casting long shadows over the insurmountable pile of mustard seeds, the Raja's Son remembered the promise of the Ant-Raja. With a desperate plea, he called out. Suddenly, from every crevice and crack, millions upon millions of tiny ants emerged, a living, moving carpet. The Ant-Raja led them, and with unparalleled coordination and tireless effort, they meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting a river of oil by dawn. The King awoke to find the impossible task miraculously completed, leaving him speechless.\nFurious at the Prince’s success, the King immediately concocted an even deadlier trial. He declared that two monstrous demons, known for their insatiable hunger and terrifying strength, had been terrorizing the distant villages, and commanded the Raja's Son to slay them before the next full moon. This task was designed to be his doom, for these demons had already claimed the lives of countless brave warriors, and their lair was said to be impregnable.\nWith courage born of desperation, the Raja's Son ventured towards the demons' infamous lair, calling upon the Tiger he had once saved. True to its word, the magnificent Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. With a primal roar that shook the earth, the powerful beast sprang into action, confronting the monstrous demons. Its unparalleled ferocity and cunning made quick work of the fearsome creatures, leaving them vanquished and the surrounding lands safe once more, fulfilling its sacred vow to the astonished Prince.\nStill unwilling to accept the Young Prince as his son-in-law, the King presented a third impossible challenge. He pointed to a giant kettle_drum, suspended impossibly high in the vast, empty sky, a symbol of royal power that had remained untouched for centuries. \"Beat that drum,\" the King boomed, \"and let its thunder echo through the heavens! Only then will I consider you worthy of my daughter!\" The entire court gasped, for no ladder could reach, and no human could leap so high.\nWithout a moment's hesitation, the Raja's Son brought forth the magic bed he had acquired from the quarreling Fakirs. With a quiet command, the enchanted bed lifted him effortlessly into the azure sky, soaring higher and higher until he reached the suspended kettle_drum. With a mighty flourish, he struck the massive instrument, and its resounding boom echoed across the entire kingdom, a sound that filled the hearts of the people with wonder and hope, and the King with seething frustration.\nIn a final, desperate attempt to rid himself of the persistent suitor, the King presented what he believed to be the ultimate, foolproof impossibility. He led the Raja's Son to an ancient, colossal Banyan tree, its branches reaching like gnarled arms into the heavens. \"Cut down this tree,\" the King declared, \"but you must use this!\" He handed the Prince a fragile hatchet made entirely of soft, pliable wax. The King watched with a cruel smirk, certain that this time, his rival would surely fail.\nAs the Prince stood before the mighty tree, a sense of despair crept in, the wax hatchet melting in his hand under the warm sun. But then, Princess Labam, who had been secretly observing, stepped forward. With a knowing glance and a whispered word of encouragement, she plucked a single strand of hair from her head, radiant with an inner magic, and pressed it into his hand. \"Use this, my love,\" she urged. To the astonishment of all, the magic hair, sharper than any blade, sliced through the colossal tree as if it were mere butter, felling it in a single, effortless stroke.\nHaving passed all the King's impossible tests with the aid of his allies and the ingenuity of Princess Labam, the Raja's Son finally married his beloved Princess in a magnificent ceremony that lasted for seven days and seven nights. Their union was celebrated with joyous feasts and grand festivities throughout the land. With his beautiful bride by his side, the victorious Young Prince then returned to his own kingdom, where he was welcomed with immense pride by his parents, ready to rule wisely and justly, forever remembering the courage and kindness that had won him Princess Labam.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Raja's Son\"], \"receivers\": [\"Princess Labam\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"Princess Labam\", \"alias\": \"Princess\", \"archetype\": \"Other\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

There lie dangers and distractions that would turn your heart from your duties and bring sorrow upon our house.\" The Young Prince, ever dutiful, nodded, though a spark of untamed curiosity flickered in his youthful eyes.\nFor many moons, the Young Prince honored his mother's interdiction, but the lure of the unknown proved too strong for his adventurous spirit. One scorching afternoon, feigning a chase after a phantom deer, he led his retinue to the foothills of the northern mountains. Dismissing his companions, he slipped into the forbidden territory, where the verdant forest seemed to hum with an ancient magic. There, perched regally upon a giant banyan tree, he encountered the magnificent Hiraman Parrot, its plumage a kaleidoscope of jewels, its eyes wise and knowing.\nThe Hiraman Parrot, observing the Raja's Son's awe, spoke in a voice like tinkling bells, \"Young Prince, your mother forbids this land because it holds a secret more precious than gold: Princess Labam, whose beauty outshines the moon, whose grace flows like a mountain stream, and whose wisdom rivals that of ancient sages. She resides in the palace beyond these peaks, and no mortal man has ever gazed upon her without falling instantly and hopelessly in love.\" The parrot's words painted a vivid image in the Young Prince's mind, igniting an unquenchable flame of desire for Princess Labam.\nConsumed by his newfound yearning, the Raja's Son returned to his parents and, with a heart full of conviction, declared his intention to journey to the kingdom of Princess Labam. His parents, initially heartbroken and apprehensive, tried to dissuade him, reminding him of the dangers and the Rani's earlier warning. But seeing the unwavering resolve in his eyes, they eventually relented, blessing his quest and providing him with the finest steeds, ample provisions, and a pouch of shimmering gold coins for his epic journey.\nAs the Young Prince traveled through sun-drenched plains, he stumbled upon a long procession of tiny ants, struggling valiantly to carry grains of rice many times their size across his path.

Determined to be rid of this unwelcome suitor, the King devised a seemingly impossible test: the Raja's Son was commanded to crush oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds, a task that would take hundreds of laborers weeks to complete, and he was given but a single day to finish it, or forfeit his life.\n\nSummary:\n\n\nExisting Characters:\n- Raja's Son (aliases: The Young Prince)\n- Rani (aliases: Mother)\n- Hiraman Parrot (aliases: The Raja of Parrots)\n- Ant-Raja\n- Tiger\n- Four Fakirs\n- Old Woman (aliases: Aunty)\n- Princess Labam (aliases: Princess)\n\n\n\nFull Story Context:\nIn the opulent palace, the wise Rani, mother to the young Raja's Son, sat him down with a solemn expression. \"My son,\" she began, \"you may hunt in the eastern forests, the western groves, and the southern plains, but never, under any circumstance, venture to the fourth side, the lands beyond the northern mountains. There lie dangers and distractions that would turn your heart from your duties and bring sorrow upon our house.\" The Young Prince, ever dutiful, nodded, though a spark of untamed curiosity flickered in his youthful eyes.\nFor many moons, the Young Prince honored his mother's interdiction, but the lure of the unknown proved too strong for his adventurous spirit. One scorching afternoon, feigning a chase after a phantom deer, he led his retinue to the foothills of the northern mountains. Dismissing his companions, he slipped into the forbidden territory, where the verdant forest seemed to hum with an ancient magic. There, perched regally upon a giant banyan tree, he encountered the magnificent Hiraman Parrot, its plumage a kaleidoscope of jewels, its eyes wise and knowing.\nThe Hiraman Parrot, observing the Raja's Son's awe, spoke in a voice like tinkling bells, \"Young Prince, your mother forbids this land because it holds a secret more precious than gold: Princess Labam, whose beauty outshines the moon, whose grace flows like a mountain stream, and whose wisdom rivals that of ancient sages. She resides in the palace beyond these peaks, and no mortal man has ever gazed upon her without falling instantly and hopelessly in love.\" The parrot's words painted a vivid image in the Young Prince's mind, igniting an unquenchable flame of desire for Princess Labam.\nConsumed by his newfound yearning, the Raja's Son returned to his parents and, with a heart full of conviction, declared his intention to journey to the kingdom of Princess Labam. His parents, initially heartbroken and apprehensive, tried to dissuade him, reminding him of the dangers and the Rani's earlier warning. But seeing the unwavering resolve in his eyes, they eventually relented, blessing his quest and providing him with the finest steeds, ample provisions, and a pouch of shimmering gold coins for his epic journey.\nAs the Young Prince traveled through sun-drenched plains, he stumbled upon a long procession of tiny ants, struggling valiantly to carry grains of rice many times their size across his path. Instead of trampling them or dismissing their efforts, he dismounted, carefully cleared a wide, smooth path for them, and even scattered a few extra grains of rice from his own provisions. Suddenly, the Ant-Raja, distinguishable by his slightly larger size and regal bearing, emerged, bowing deeply. \"Noble Prince,\" he chirped, \"you have shown kindness to my people. Should you ever need assistance, remember the Ant-Raja, and we shall come to your aid.\"\nFurther on, deep within a dense jungle, the Raja's Son heard the piteous roars of a mighty Tiger, trapped in a hunter's snare. Despite the inherent danger, the Young Prince, remembering his own yearning heart, approached the thrashing beast with compassion. With great effort and courage, he painstakingly untangled the thick ropes, freeing the magnificent creature. The Tiger, momentarily subdued by pain, licked the prince's hand in gratitude. \"My Prince,\" it rumbled, its voice deep and resonant, \"you have saved my life. Whenever you face insurmountable odds, call upon me, and I shall come like the wind to serve you.\"\nContinuing his journey, the Young Prince encountered four quarrelsome Fakirs, squabbling bitterly over their magical possessions: a flying bed, an inexhaustible bag of food, a bowl that produced any desired drink, and a magic stick that could create a strong rope from thin air. Cleverly, the Prince proposed a contest: whoever could climb the tallest tree and touch the sky first would claim all the items. As the foolish Fakirs exhausted themselves in futile attempts, the Raja's Son, with nimble fingers and a silent prayer, deftly collected all four unattended magical objects, securing powerful tools for his quest.\nFinally arriving at the outskirts of Princess Labam's kingdom, the Young Prince, wisely choosing to maintain his anonymity, sought shelter in a small, humble hut. There lived an old woman, with kindly eyes and a weary frame. Approaching her with respect and feigning distress, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, lost in his travels. The Old Woman, her heart touched by his polite demeanor and plausible tale, welcomed him warmly, offering him food and a place to rest, unaware of his true identity or the grand purpose of his stealthy arrival.\nUnder the cloak of the new moon, using the magic bed to navigate unseen, the Raja's Son floated silently into the Princess's bejeweled chambers. Princess Labam lay asleep, a vision of ethereal beauty, just as the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a long moment, his heart swelling with reverence, before quietly placing a meticulously folded betel-leaf, fragrant and auspicious, beside her silken pillow. It was a silent, traditional token of admiration, a hint of his presence, leaving her to ponder the mysterious gift upon waking.\nSeveral nights later, emboldened by the Princess's apparent acceptance of the previous gift—for the betel-leaf had vanished by morning—the Young Prince returned to her sleeping chambers. This time, he decided on a more significant offering, a shimmering shawl woven from the finest silk, adorned with intricate gold embroidery. He draped it carefully over her delicate form, once again silently observing her serene beauty before departing as stealthily as he had arrived, leaving behind another undeniable mark of his unseen presence.\nOn his next visit, as Princess Labam awoke and discovered him in her chamber, her initial alarm quickly turned to a flush of recognition. Having found the betel-leaf and the shawl, her heart had already begun to weave tales of a secret admirer, and his appearance only confirmed her unspoken hopes. With a gentle voice, the Raja's Son revealed his identity and the arduous journey he had undertaken for her. Princess Labam, touched by his courage and unwavering devotion, acknowledged her own stirring affection and, with a shy smile, accepted his proposal of marriage.\nWhen the news of their secret betrothal reached the King, Princess Labam's father, his rage was immense. He was a proud and arrogant ruler, and this unknown prince was an insult to his royal lineage. Determined to be rid of this unwelcome suitor, the King devised a seemingly impossible test: the Raja's Son was commanded to crush oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds, a task that would take hundreds of laborers weeks to complete, and he was given but a single day to finish it, or forfeit his life.\nAs the sun began its descent, casting long shadows over the insurmountable pile of mustard seeds, the Raja's Son remembered the promise of the Ant-Raja. With a desperate plea, he called out. Suddenly, from every crevice and crack, millions upon millions of tiny ants emerged, a living, moving carpet. The Ant-Raja led them, and with unparalleled coordination and tireless effort, they meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting a river of oil by dawn. The King awoke to find the impossible task miraculously completed, leaving him speechless.\nFurious at the Prince’s success, the King immediately concocted an even deadlier trial. He declared that two monstrous demons, known for their insatiable hunger and terrifying strength, had been terrorizing the distant villages, and commanded the Raja's Son to slay them before the next full moon. This task was designed to be his doom, for these demons had already claimed the lives of countless brave warriors, and their lair was said to be impregnable.\nWith courage born of desperation, the Raja's Son ventured towards the demons' infamous lair, calling upon the Tiger he had once saved. True to its word, the magnificent Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. With a primal roar that shook the earth, the powerful beast sprang into action, confronting the monstrous demons. Its unparalleled ferocity and cunning made quick work of the fearsome creatures, leaving them vanquished and the surrounding lands safe once more, fulfilling its sacred vow to the astonished Prince.\nStill unwilling to accept the Young Prince as his son-in-law, the King presented a third impossible challenge. He pointed to a giant kettle_drum, suspended impossibly high in the vast, empty sky, a symbol of royal power that had remained untouched for centuries. \"Beat that drum,\" the King boomed, \"and let its thunder echo through the heavens! Only then will I consider you worthy of my daughter!\" The entire court gasped, for no ladder could reach, and no human could leap so high.\nWithout a moment's hesitation, the Raja's Son brought forth the magic bed he had acquired from the quarreling Fakirs. With a quiet command, the enchanted bed lifted him effortlessly into the azure sky, soaring higher and higher until he reached the suspended kettle_drum. With a mighty flourish, he struck the massive instrument, and its resounding boom echoed across the entire kingdom, a sound that filled the hearts of the people with wonder and hope, and the King with seething frustration.\nIn a final, desperate attempt to rid himself of the persistent suitor, the King presented what he believed to be the ultimate, foolproof impossibility. He led the Raja's Son to an ancient, colossal Banyan tree, its branches reaching like gnarled arms into the heavens. \"Cut down this tree,\" the King declared, \"but you must use this!\" He handed the Prince a fragile hatchet made entirely of soft, pliable wax. The King watched with a cruel smirk, certain that this time, his rival would surely fail.\nAs the Prince stood before the mighty tree, a sense of despair crept in, the wax hatchet melting in his hand under the warm sun. But then, Princess Labam, who had been secretly observing, stepped forward. With a knowing glance and a whispered word of encouragement, she plucked a single strand of hair from her head, radiant with an inner magic, and pressed it into his hand. \"Use this, my love,\" she urged. To the astonishment of all, the magic hair, sharper than any blade, sliced through the colossal tree as if it were mere butter, felling it in a single, effortless stroke.\nHaving passed all the King's impossible tests with the aid of his allies and the ingenuity of Princess Labam, the Raja's Son finally married his beloved Princess in a magnificent ceremony that lasted for seven days and seven nights. Their union was celebrated with joyous feasts and grand festivities throughout the land. With his beautiful bride by his side, the victorious Young Prince then returned to his own kingdom, where he was welcomed with immense pride by his parents, ready to rule wisely and justly, forever remembering the courage and kindness that had won him Princess Labam.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"The King\"], \"receivers\": [\"Raja's Son\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"The King\", \"alias\": \"Princess Labam's Father\", \"archetype\": \"Villain\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

With a mighty flourish, he struck the massive instrument, and its resounding boom echoed across the entire kingdom, a sound that filled the hearts of the people with wonder and hope, and the King with seething frustration.\nIn a final, desperate attempt to rid himself of the persistent suitor, the King presented what he believed to be the ultimate, foolproof impossibility. He led the Raja's Son to an ancient, colossal Banyan tree, its branches reaching like gnarled arms into the heavens. \"Cut down this tree,\" the King declared, \"but you must use this!\" He handed the Prince a fragile hatchet made entirely of soft, pliable wax. The King watched with a cruel smirk, certain that this time, his rival would surely fail.\nAs the Prince stood before the mighty tree, a sense of despair crept in, the wax hatchet melting in his hand under the warm sun. But then, Princess Labam, who had been secretly observing, stepped forward. With a knowing glance and a whispered word of encouragement, she plucked a single strand of hair from her head, radiant with an inner magic, and pressed it into his hand. \"Use this, my love,\" she urged. To the astonishment of all, the magic hair, sharper than any blade, sliced through the colossal tree as if it were mere butter, felling it in a single, effortless stroke.\nHaving passed all the King's impossible tests with the aid of his allies and the ingenuity of Princess Labam, the Raja's Son finally married his beloved Princess in a magnificent ceremony that lasted for seven days and seven nights. Their union was celebrated with joyous feasts and grand festivities throughout the land. With his beautiful bride by his side, the victorious Young Prince then returned to his own kingdom, where he was welcomed with immense pride by his parents, ready to rule wisely and justly, forever remembering the courage and kindness that had won him Princess Labam.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"The King\"], \"receivers\": [\"Raja's Son\"], \"new_characters\": [], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

There lie dangers and distractions that would turn your heart from your duties and bring sorrow upon our house.\" The Young Prince, ever dutiful, nodded, though a spark of untamed curiosity flickered in his youthful eyes.\nFor many moons, the Young Prince honored his mother's interdiction, but the lure of the unknown proved too strong for his adventurous spirit. One scorching afternoon, feigning a chase after a phantom deer, he led his retinue to the foothills of the northern mountains. Dismissing his companions, he slipped into the forbidden territory, where the verdant forest seemed to hum with an ancient magic. There, perched regally upon a giant banyan tree, he encountered the magnificent Hiraman Parrot, its plumage a kaleidoscope of jewels, its eyes wise and knowing.\nThe Hiraman Parrot, observing the Raja's Son's awe, spoke in a voice like tinkling bells, \"Young Prince, your mother forbids this land because it holds a secret more precious than gold: Princess Labam, whose beauty outshines the moon, whose grace flows like a mountain stream, and whose wisdom rivals that of ancient sages. She resides in the palace beyond these peaks, and no mortal man has ever gazed upon her without falling instantly and hopelessly in love.\" The parrot's words painted a vivid image in the Young Prince's mind, igniting an unquenchable flame of desire for Princess Labam.\nConsumed by his newfound yearning, the Raja's Son returned to his parents and, with a heart full of conviction, declared his intention to journey to the kingdom of Princess Labam. His parents, initially heartbroken and apprehensive, tried to dissuade him, reminding him of the dangers and the Rani's earlier warning. But seeing the unwavering resolve in his eyes, they eventually relented, blessing his quest and providing him with the finest steeds, ample provisions, and a pouch of shimmering gold coins for his epic journey.\nAs the Young Prince traveled through sun-drenched plains, he stumbled upon a long procession of tiny ants, struggling valiantly to carry grains of rice many times their size across his path. Instead of trampling them or dismissing their efforts, he dismounted, carefully cleared a wide, smooth path for them, and even scattered a few extra grains of rice from his own provisions. Suddenly, the Ant-Raja, distinguishable by his slightly larger size and regal bearing, emerged, bowing deeply. \"Noble Prince,\" he chirped, \"you have shown kindness to my people. Should you ever need assistance, remember the Ant-Raja, and we shall come to your aid.\"\nFurther on, deep within a dense jungle, the Raja's Son heard the piteous roars of a mighty Tiger, trapped in a hunter's snare. Despite the inherent danger, the Young Prince, remembering his own yearning heart, approached the thrashing beast with compassion. With great effort and courage, he painstakingly untangled the thick ropes, freeing the magnificent creature. The Tiger, momentarily subdued by pain, licked the prince's hand in gratitude. \"My Prince,\" it rumbled, its voice deep and resonant, \"you have saved my life. Whenever you face insurmountable odds, call upon me, and I shall come like the wind to serve you.\"\nContinuing his journey, the Young Prince encountered four quarrelsome Fakirs, squabbling bitterly over their magical possessions: a flying bed, an inexhaustible bag of food, a bowl that produced any desired drink, and a magic stick that could create a strong rope from thin air. Cleverly, the Prince proposed a contest: whoever could climb the tallest tree and touch the sky first would claim all the items. As the foolish Fakirs exhausted themselves in futile attempts, the Raja's Son, with nimble fingers and a silent prayer, deftly collected all four unattended magical objects, securing powerful tools for his quest.\nFinally arriving at the outskirts of Princess Labam's kingdom, the Young Prince, wisely choosing to maintain his anonymity, sought shelter in a small, humble hut. There lived an old woman, with kindly eyes and a weary frame. Approaching her with respect and feigning distress, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, lost in his travels. The Old Woman, her heart touched by his polite demeanor and plausible tale, welcomed him warmly, offering him food and a place to rest, unaware of his true identity or the grand purpose of his stealthy arrival.\nUnder the cloak of the new moon, using the magic bed to navigate unseen, the Raja's Son floated silently into the Princess's bejeweled chambers. Princess Labam lay asleep, a vision of ethereal beauty, just as the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a long moment, his heart swelling with reverence, before quietly placing a meticulously folded betel-leaf, fragrant and auspicious, beside her silken pillow. It was a silent, traditional token of admiration, a hint of his presence, leaving her to ponder the mysterious gift upon waking.\nSeveral nights later, emboldened by the Princess's apparent acceptance of the previous gift—for the betel-leaf had vanished by morning—the Young Prince returned to her sleeping chambers. This time, he decided on a more significant offering, a shimmering shawl woven from the finest silk, adorned with intricate gold embroidery. He draped it carefully over her delicate form, once again silently observing her serene beauty before departing as stealthily as he had arrived, leaving behind another undeniable mark of his unseen presence.\nOn his next visit, as Princess Labam awoke and discovered him in her chamber, her initial alarm quickly turned to a flush of recognition. Having found the betel-leaf and the shawl, her heart had already begun to weave tales of a secret admirer, and his appearance only confirmed her unspoken hopes. With a gentle voice, the Raja's Son revealed his identity and the arduous journey he had undertaken for her. Princess Labam, touched by his courage and unwavering devotion, acknowledged her own stirring affection and, with a shy smile, accepted his proposal of marriage.\nWhen the news of their secret betrothal reached the King, Princess Labam's father, his rage was immense. He was a proud and arrogant ruler, and this unknown prince was an insult to his royal lineage. Determined to be rid of this unwelcome suitor, the King devised a seemingly impossible test: the Raja's Son was commanded to crush oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds, a task that would take hundreds of laborers weeks to complete, and he was given but a single day to finish it, or forfeit his life.\nAs the sun began its descent, casting long shadows over the insurmountable pile of mustard seeds, the Raja's Son remembered the promise of the Ant-Raja. With a desperate plea, he called out. Suddenly, from every crevice and crack, millions upon millions of tiny ants emerged, a living, moving carpet. The Ant-Raja led them, and with unparalleled coordination and tireless effort, they meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting a river of oil by dawn. The King awoke to find the impossible task miraculously completed, leaving him speechless.\nFurious at the Prince’s success, the King immediately concocted an even deadlier trial. He declared that two monstrous demons, known for their insatiable hunger and terrifying strength, had been terrorizing the distant villages, and commanded the Raja's Son to slay them before the next full moon. This task was designed to be his doom, for these demons had already claimed the lives of countless brave warriors, and their lair was said to be impregnable.\nWith courage born of desperation, the Raja's Son ventured towards the demons' infamous lair, calling upon the Tiger he had once saved. True to its word, the magnificent Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. With a primal roar that shook the earth, the powerful beast sprang into action, confronting the monstrous demons. Its unparalleled ferocity and cunning made quick work of the fearsome creatures, leaving them vanquished and the surrounding lands safe once more, fulfilling its sacred vow to the astonished Prince.\nStill unwilling to accept the Young Prince as his son-in-law, the King presented a third impossible challenge. He pointed to a giant kettle_drum, suspended impossibly high in the vast, empty sky, a symbol of royal power that had remained untouched for centuries. \"Beat that drum,\" the King boomed, \"and let its thunder echo through the heavens! Only then will I consider you worthy of my daughter!\" The entire court gasped, for no ladder could reach, and no human could leap so high.\nWithout a moment's hesitation, the Raja's Son brought forth the magic bed he had acquired from the quarreling Fakirs.

He draped it carefully over her delicate form, once again silently observing her serene beauty before departing as stealthily as he had arrived, leaving behind another undeniable mark of his unseen presence.\nOn his next visit, as Princess Labam awoke and discovered him in her chamber, her initial alarm quickly turned to a flush of recognition. Having found the betel-leaf and the shawl, her heart had already begun to weave tales of a secret admirer, and his appearance only confirmed her unspoken hopes. With a gentle voice, the Raja's Son revealed his identity and the arduous journey he had undertaken for her. Princess Labam, touched by his courage and unwavering devotion, acknowledged her own stirring affection and, with a shy smile, accepted his proposal of marriage.\nWhen the news of their secret betrothal reached the King, Princess Labam's father, his rage was immense. He was a proud and arrogant ruler, and this unknown prince was an insult to his royal lineage. Determined to be rid of this unwelcome suitor, the King devised a seemingly impossible test: the Raja's Son was commanded to crush oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds, a task that would take hundreds of laborers weeks to complete, and he was given but a single day to finish it, or forfeit his life.\nAs the sun began its descent, casting long shadows over the insurmountable pile of mustard seeds, the Raja's Son remembered the promise of the Ant-Raja. With a desperate plea, he called out. Suddenly, from every crevice and crack, millions upon millions of tiny ants emerged, a living, moving carpet. The Ant-Raja led them, and with unparalleled coordination and tireless effort, they meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting a river of oil by dawn. The King awoke to find the impossible task miraculously completed, leaving him speechless.\nFurious at the Prince’s success, the King immediately concocted an even deadlier trial. He declared that two monstrous demons, known for their insatiable hunger and terrifying strength, had been terrorizing the distant villages, and commanded the Raja's Son to slay them before the next full moon. This task was designed to be his doom, for these demons had already claimed the lives of countless brave warriors, and their lair was said to be impregnable.\nWith courage born of desperation, the Raja's Son ventured towards the demons' infamous lair, calling upon the Tiger he had once saved. True to its word, the magnificent Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. With a primal roar that shook the earth, the powerful beast sprang into action, confronting the monstrous demons. Its unparalleled ferocity and cunning made quick work of the fearsome creatures, leaving them vanquished and the surrounding lands safe once more, fulfilling its sacred vow to the astonished Prince.\nStill unwilling to accept the Young Prince as his son-in-law, the King presented a third impossible challenge. He pointed to a giant kettle_drum, suspended impossibly high in the vast, empty sky, a symbol of royal power that had remained untouched for centuries. \"Beat that drum,\" the King boomed, \"and let its thunder echo through the heavens! Only then will I consider you worthy of my daughter!\" The entire court gasped, for no ladder could reach, and no human could leap so high.\nWithout a moment's hesitation, the Raja's Son brought forth the magic bed he had acquired from the quarreling Fakirs. With a quiet command, the enchanted bed lifted him effortlessly into the azure sky, soaring higher and higher until he reached the suspended kettle_drum. With a mighty flourish, he struck the massive instrument, and its resounding boom echoed across the entire kingdom, a sound that filled the hearts of the people with wonder and hope, and the King with seething frustration.\nIn a final, desperate attempt to rid himself of the persistent suitor, the King presented what he believed to be the ultimate, foolproof impossibility. He led the Raja's Son to an ancient, colossal Banyan tree, its branches reaching like gnarled arms into the heavens. \"Cut down this tree,\" the King declared, \"but you must use this!\" He handed the Prince a fragile hatchet made entirely of soft, pliable wax. The King watched with a cruel smirk, certain that this time, his rival would surely fail.\nAs the Prince stood before the mighty tree, a sense of despair crept in, the wax hatchet melting in his hand under the warm sun. But then, Princess Labam, who had been secretly observing, stepped forward. With a knowing glance and a whispered word of encouragement, she plucked a single strand of hair from her head, radiant with an inner magic, and pressed it into his hand. \"Use this, my love,\" she urged. To the astonishment of all, the magic hair, sharper than any blade, sliced through the colossal tree as if it were mere butter, felling it in a single, effortless stroke.\nHaving passed all the King's impossible tests with the aid of his allies and the ingenuity of Princess Labam, the Raja's Son finally married his beloved Princess in a magnificent ceremony that lasted for seven days and seven nights. Their union was celebrated with joyous feasts and grand festivities throughout the land. With his beautiful bride by his side, the victorious Young Prince then returned to his own kingdom, where he was welcomed with immense pride by his parents, ready to rule wisely and justly, forever remembering the courage and kindness that had won him Princess Labam.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Raja's Son\"], \"receivers\": [\"Drum\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"Drum\", \"alias\": \"kettle_drum\", \"archetype\": \"Other\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

There lie dangers and distractions that would turn your heart from your duties and bring sorrow upon our house.\" The Young Prince, ever dutiful, nodded, though a spark of untamed curiosity flickered in his youthful eyes.\nFor many moons, the Young Prince honored his mother's interdiction, but the lure of the unknown proved too strong for his adventurous spirit. One scorching afternoon, feigning a chase after a phantom deer, he led his retinue to the foothills of the northern mountains. Dismissing his companions, he slipped into the forbidden territory, where the verdant forest seemed to hum with an ancient magic. There, perched regally upon a giant banyan tree, he encountered the magnificent Hiraman Parrot, its plumage a kaleidoscope of jewels, its eyes wise and knowing.\nThe Hiraman Parrot, observing the Raja's Son's awe, spoke in a voice like tinkling bells, \"Young Prince, your mother forbids this land because it holds a secret more precious than gold: Princess Labam, whose beauty outshines the moon, whose grace flows like a mountain stream, and whose wisdom rivals that of ancient sages. She resides in the palace beyond these peaks, and no mortal man has ever gazed upon her without falling instantly and hopelessly in love.\" The parrot's words painted a vivid image in the Young Prince's mind, igniting an unquenchable flame of desire for Princess Labam.\nConsumed by his newfound yearning, the Raja's Son returned to his parents and, with a heart full of conviction, declared his intention to journey to the kingdom of Princess Labam. His parents, initially heartbroken and apprehensive, tried to dissuade him, reminding him of the dangers and the Rani's earlier warning. But seeing the unwavering resolve in his eyes, they eventually relented, blessing his quest and providing him with the finest steeds, ample provisions, and a pouch of shimmering gold coins for his epic journey.\nAs the Young Prince traveled through sun-drenched plains, he stumbled upon a long procession of tiny ants, struggling valiantly to carry grains of rice many times their size across his path. Instead of trampling them or dismissing their efforts, he dismounted, carefully cleared a wide, smooth path for them, and even scattered a few extra grains of rice from his own provisions. Suddenly, the Ant-Raja, distinguishable by his slightly larger size and regal bearing, emerged, bowing deeply. \"Noble Prince,\" he chirped, \"you have shown kindness to my people. Should you ever need assistance, remember the Ant-Raja, and we shall come to your aid.\"\nFurther on, deep within a dense jungle, the Raja's Son heard the piteous roars of a mighty Tiger, trapped in a hunter's snare. Despite the inherent danger, the Young Prince, remembering his own yearning heart, approached the thrashing beast with compassion. With great effort and courage, he painstakingly untangled the thick ropes, freeing the magnificent creature. The Tiger, momentarily subdued by pain, licked the prince's hand in gratitude. \"My Prince,\" it rumbled, its voice deep and resonant, \"you have saved my life. Whenever you face insurmountable odds, call upon me, and I shall come like the wind to serve you.\"\nContinuing his journey, the Young Prince encountered four quarrelsome Fakirs, squabbling bitterly over their magical possessions: a flying bed, an inexhaustible bag of food, a bowl that produced any desired drink, and a magic stick that could create a strong rope from thin air. Cleverly, the Prince proposed a contest: whoever could climb the tallest tree and touch the sky first would claim all the items. As the foolish Fakirs exhausted themselves in futile attempts, the Raja's Son, with nimble fingers and a silent prayer, deftly collected all four unattended magical objects, securing powerful tools for his quest.\nFinally arriving at the outskirts of Princess Labam's kingdom, the Young Prince, wisely choosing to maintain his anonymity, sought shelter in a small, humble hut. There lived an old woman, with kindly eyes and a weary frame. Approaching her with respect and feigning distress, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, lost in his travels. The Old Woman, her heart touched by his polite demeanor and plausible tale, welcomed him warmly, offering him food and a place to rest, unaware of his true identity or the grand purpose of his stealthy arrival.\nUnder the cloak of the new moon, using the magic bed to navigate unseen, the Raja's Son floated silently into the Princess's bejeweled chambers. Princess Labam lay asleep, a vision of ethereal beauty, just as the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a long moment, his heart swelling with reverence, before quietly placing a meticulously folded betel-leaf, fragrant and auspicious, beside her silken pillow. It was a silent, traditional token of admiration, a hint of his presence, leaving her to ponder the mysterious gift upon waking.\nSeveral nights later, emboldened by the Princess's apparent acceptance of the previous gift—for the betel-leaf had vanished by morning—the Young Prince returned to her sleeping chambers.

She resides in the palace beyond these peaks, and no mortal man has ever gazed upon her without falling instantly and hopelessly in love.\" The parrot's words painted a vivid image in the Young Prince's mind, igniting an unquenchable flame of desire for Princess Labam.\nConsumed by his newfound yearning, the Raja's Son returned to his parents and, with a heart full of conviction, declared his intention to journey to the kingdom of Princess Labam. His parents, initially heartbroken and apprehensive, tried to dissuade him, reminding him of the dangers and the Rani's earlier warning. But seeing the unwavering resolve in his eyes, they eventually relented, blessing his quest and providing him with the finest steeds, ample provisions, and a pouch of shimmering gold coins for his epic journey.\nAs the Young Prince traveled through sun-drenched plains, he stumbled upon a long procession of tiny ants, struggling valiantly to carry grains of rice many times their size across his path. Instead of trampling them or dismissing their efforts, he dismounted, carefully cleared a wide, smooth path for them, and even scattered a few extra grains of rice from his own provisions. Suddenly, the Ant-Raja, distinguishable by his slightly larger size and regal bearing, emerged, bowing deeply. \"Noble Prince,\" he chirped, \"you have shown kindness to my people. Should you ever need assistance, remember the Ant-Raja, and we shall come to your aid.\"\nFurther on, deep within a dense jungle, the Raja's Son heard the piteous roars of a mighty Tiger, trapped in a hunter's snare. Despite the inherent danger, the Young Prince, remembering his own yearning heart, approached the thrashing beast with compassion. With great effort and courage, he painstakingly untangled the thick ropes, freeing the magnificent creature. The Tiger, momentarily subdued by pain, licked the prince's hand in gratitude. \"My Prince,\" it rumbled, its voice deep and resonant, \"you have saved my life. Whenever you face insurmountable odds, call upon me, and I shall come like the wind to serve you.\"\nContinuing his journey, the Young Prince encountered four quarrelsome Fakirs, squabbling bitterly over their magical possessions: a flying bed, an inexhaustible bag of food, a bowl that produced any desired drink, and a magic stick that could create a strong rope from thin air. Cleverly, the Prince proposed a contest: whoever could climb the tallest tree and touch the sky first would claim all the items. As the foolish Fakirs exhausted themselves in futile attempts, the Raja's Son, with nimble fingers and a silent prayer, deftly collected all four unattended magical objects, securing powerful tools for his quest.\nFinally arriving at the outskirts of Princess Labam's kingdom, the Young Prince, wisely choosing to maintain his anonymity, sought shelter in a small, humble hut. There lived an old woman, with kindly eyes and a weary frame. Approaching her with respect and feigning distress, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, lost in his travels. The Old Woman, her heart touched by his polite demeanor and plausible tale, welcomed him warmly, offering him food and a place to rest, unaware of his true identity or the grand purpose of his stealthy arrival.\nUnder the cloak of the new moon, using the magic bed to navigate unseen, the Raja's Son floated silently into the Princess's bejeweled chambers. Princess Labam lay asleep, a vision of ethereal beauty, just as the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a long moment, his heart swelling with reverence, before quietly placing a meticulously folded betel-leaf, fragrant and auspicious, beside her silken pillow. It was a silent, traditional token of admiration, a hint of his presence, leaving her to ponder the mysterious gift upon waking.\nSeveral nights later, emboldened by the Princess's apparent acceptance of the previous gift—for the betel-leaf had vanished by morning—the Young Prince returned to her sleeping chambers. This time, he decided on a more significant offering, a shimmering shawl woven from the finest silk, adorned with intricate gold embroidery. He draped it carefully over her delicate form, once again silently observing her serene beauty before departing as stealthily as he had arrived, leaving behind another undeniable mark of his unseen presence.\nOn his next visit, as Princess Labam awoke and discovered him in her chamber, her initial alarm quickly turned to a flush of recognition. Having found the betel-leaf and the shawl, her heart had already begun to weave tales of a secret admirer, and his appearance only confirmed her unspoken hopes. With a gentle voice, the Raja's Son revealed his identity and the arduous journey he had undertaken for her. Princess Labam, touched by his courage and unwavering devotion, acknowledged her own stirring affection and, with a shy smile, accepted his proposal of marriage.\nWhen the news of their secret betrothal reached the King, Princess Labam's father, his rage was immense. He was a proud and arrogant ruler, and this unknown prince was an insult to his royal lineage. Determined to be rid of this unwelcome suitor, the King devised a seemingly impossible test: the Raja's Son was commanded to crush oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds, a task that would take hundreds of laborers weeks to complete, and he was given but a single day to finish it, or forfeit his life.\nAs the sun began its descent, casting long shadows over the insurmountable pile of mustard seeds, the Raja's Son remembered the promise of the Ant-Raja. With a desperate plea, he called out. Suddenly, from every crevice and crack, millions upon millions of tiny ants emerged, a living, moving carpet. The Ant-Raja led them, and with unparalleled coordination and tireless effort, they meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting a river of oil by dawn. The King awoke to find the impossible task miraculously completed, leaving him speechless.\nFurious at the Prince’s success, the King immediately concocted an even deadlier trial. He declared that two monstrous demons, known for their insatiable hunger and terrifying strength, had been terrorizing the distant villages, and commanded the Raja's Son to slay them before the next full moon. This task was designed to be his doom, for these demons had already claimed the lives of countless brave warriors, and their lair was said to be impregnable.\nWith courage born of desperation, the Raja's Son ventured towards the demons' infamous lair, calling upon the Tiger he had once saved. True to its word, the magnificent Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. With a primal roar that shook the earth, the powerful beast sprang into action, confronting the monstrous demons. Its unparalleled ferocity and cunning made quick work of the fearsome creatures, leaving them vanquished and the surrounding lands safe once more, fulfilling its sacred vow to the astonished Prince.\nStill unwilling to accept the Young Prince as his son-in-law, the King presented a third impossible challenge. He pointed to a giant kettle_drum, suspended impossibly high in the vast, empty sky, a symbol of royal power that had remained untouched for centuries. \"Beat that drum,\" the King boomed, \"and let its thunder echo through the heavens! Only then will I consider you worthy of my daughter!\" The entire court gasped, for no ladder could reach, and no human could leap so high.\nWithout a moment's hesitation, the Raja's Son brought forth the magic bed he had acquired from the quarreling Fakirs. With a quiet command, the enchanted bed lifted him effortlessly into the azure sky, soaring higher and higher until he reached the suspended kettle_drum. With a mighty flourish, he struck the massive instrument, and its resounding boom echoed across the entire kingdom, a sound that filled the hearts of the people with wonder and hope, and the King with seething frustration.\nIn a final, desperate attempt to rid himself of the persistent suitor, the King presented what he believed to be the ultimate, foolproof impossibility. He led the Raja's Son to an ancient, colossal Banyan tree, its branches reaching like gnarled arms into the heavens. \"Cut down this tree,\" the King declared, \"but you must use this!\" He handed the Prince a fragile hatchet made entirely of soft, pliable wax. The King watched with a cruel smirk, certain that this time, his rival would surely fail.\nAs the Prince stood before the mighty tree, a sense of despair crept in, the wax hatchet melting in his hand under the warm sun. But then, Princess Labam, who had been secretly observing, stepped forward. With a knowing glance and a whispered word of encouragement, she plucked a single strand of hair from her head, radiant with an inner magic, and pressed it into his hand. \"Use this, my love,\" she urged. To the astonishment of all, the magic hair, sharper than any blade, sliced through the colossal tree as if it were mere butter, felling it in a single, effortless stroke.\nHaving passed all the King's impossible tests with the aid of his allies and the ingenuity of Princess Labam, the Raja's Son finally married his beloved Princess in a magnificent ceremony that lasted for seven days and seven nights. Their union was celebrated with joyous feasts and grand festivities throughout the land. With his beautiful bride by his side, the victorious Young Prince then returned to his own kingdom, where he was welcomed with immense pride by his parents, ready to rule wisely and justly, forever remembering the courage and kindness that had won him Princess Labam.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Raja's Son\"], \"receivers\": [\"Princess Labam\"], \"new_characters\": [], \"notes\": \"\"}"}
