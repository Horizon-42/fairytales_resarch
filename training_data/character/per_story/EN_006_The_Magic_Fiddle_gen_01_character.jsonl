They saw her beauty as a threat, her sweet nature an unbearable contrast to their own sharp tongues. Gathering in the darkest corner of the communal courtyard, beneath the heavy gaze of the moonless sky, they whispered their wicked scheme: to lure her to the ancient, forbidden pool on the edge of the jungle, a place rumored to be the dwelling of a powerful, malevolent Bonga spirit, and offer her as a sacrifice to remove her from their lives forever.\nFeigning a sacred ritual that required a maiden's pure offering, the Seven Wives led the unsuspecting Bonga Girl, adorned in simple white cloth, to the deep, swirling waters of the spirit pool. The air grew heavy and cold as they approached. With a sudden, synchronized push, they thrust her into the murky depths. The water itself seemed to writhe, and though no tangible spirit emerged, an unseen force pulled the Bonga Girl down, her last gasping cries swallowed by the cold, dark embrace of the spirit world, leaving no trace but widening ripples on the surface.\nYet, the spirit of the innocent Bonga Girl refused to be extinguished. From the very spot on the riverbank where her last tear had fallen, a slender shoot of bamboo, vibrant and unusually tall, began to sprout. Nature, a silent witness to her unjust fate, nurtured it with sunlight and rain, allowing it to grow with a miraculous speed and grace. Its hollow joints seemed to hum with a faint, melancholic melody, a living testament to the pure soul that had transfigured, now encased within its emerald green stalks, whispering of what once was.\nA few seasons later, a wandering Jogi, with matted locks and eyes that had seen many lifetimes, chanced upon this remarkable bamboo grove. Drawn by an inexplicable allure, he singled out the tallest, most luminous stalk. As he raised his sharp knife, a faint, almost inaudible plea, like the rustle of leaves in a gentle breeze, seemed to eman emanate from the bamboo, a soft, ethereal sigh. But the Jogi, intent on his craft, dismissed it as the wind's play. He skillfully cut the stalk, then with expert hands, fashioned it into an exquisite fiddle, its wood warm and resonant to his touch.\nThe Jogi, traveling with his wondrous new fiddle, soon arrived at the Chief's village, where a great festival was in full swing. His music, born from the magical bamboo, enchanted all who heard it. The Chief's Family, particularly the elders, became utterly captivated by the instrument's ethereal sound. Desiring its unique magic for themselves, they plied the simple Jogi with potent rice wine and other intoxicating libations until he slumped into a deep, dreamless slumber. Under the cloak of night, they stealthily relieved him of the magical fiddle, spiriting it away to the Chief's palace.\nEach morning, the young Chief's Son awoke to a subtle miracle within his chambers. His sleeping mat would be neatly folded, his scattered possessions tidied, and a faint, sweet aroma of jasmine would perfume the air, though no servant had entered. The fiddle, placed reverently in his room, often seemed to hum softly when he was out, and he sometimes caught the fleeting scent of freshly laundered linen or saw a shimmering shadow at the corner of his eye. It was the Bonga Girl, now able to emerge from the fiddle, drawn by the Chief’s Son’s kind spirit, performing these loving duties, always vanishing before she could be seen.\nDetermined to uncover the source of these daily blessings, the Chief's Son feigned a deep sleep one night, his heart pounding with anticipation. As the moon dipped low, a shimmering form, radiant and ethereal, emerged from the magical fiddle. It was a maiden of unparalleled beauty, her eyes holding the depth of ancient sorrow. Gently, the Young Chief spoke her name, extending his hand. Startled, she tried to retreat, but his gentle sincerity held her. With tears in her eyes, she revealed her tragic story: the treachery of her sisters-in-law, her drowning, her reincarnation as the bamboo, and her life within the fiddle. Overwhelmed by her tale and utterly smitten by her pure spirit, the Young Chief declared his love and, with his family's joyous consent, they were wed in a magnificent ceremony.\nNews of the Chief's Son's marriage reached far and wide, eventually drawing the Seven Brothers, accompanied by their Seven Wives, to the Chief's palace for a courtesy visit, entirely unaware of their sister’s astonishing return. During a grand feast, the now-radiant Bonga Girl, seated beside her beloved husband, rose gracefully. With a steady gaze fixed upon her stunned brothers and their paling wives, she revealed her true identity, recounting the treacherous act that had cast her into the spirit world and transformed her. The Seven Brothers, their faces etched with horror and shame, finally comprehended the heinous deed their wives had committed and their own tragic negligence, as the entire court looked on in solemn, silent judgment.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Seven Wives\"], \"receivers\": [\"Bonga Girl\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"Bonga Girl\", \"alias\": \"sister\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"}, {\"name\": \"Seven Wives\", \"alias\": \"Sisters-in-law\", \"archetype\": \"Villain\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

His sleeping mat would be neatly folded, his scattered possessions tidied, and a faint, sweet aroma of jasmine would perfume the air, though no servant had entered. The fiddle, placed reverently in his room, often seemed to hum softly when he was out, and he sometimes caught the fleeting scent of freshly laundered linen or saw a shimmering shadow at the corner of his eye. It was the Bonga Girl, now able to emerge from the fiddle, drawn by the Chief’s Son’s kind spirit, performing these loving duties, always vanishing before she could be seen.\n\nSummary:\n\n\nExisting Characters:\n- Bonga Girl (aliases: sister)\n- Seven Wives (aliases: Sisters-in-law)\n- nature\n- The Jogi\n- Chief's Family\n\n\n\nFull Story Context:\nThe Seven Wives, their hearts curdled with envy for their sister-in-law, the gentle Bonga Girl, plotted her demise with cunning malice. They saw her beauty as a threat, her sweet nature an unbearable contrast to their own sharp tongues. Gathering in the darkest corner of the communal courtyard, beneath the heavy gaze of the moonless sky, they whispered their wicked scheme: to lure her to the ancient, forbidden pool on the edge of the jungle, a place rumored to be the dwelling of a powerful, malevolent Bonga spirit, and offer her as a sacrifice to remove her from their lives forever.\nFeigning a sacred ritual that required a maiden's pure offering, the Seven Wives led the unsuspecting Bonga Girl, adorned in simple white cloth, to the deep, swirling waters of the spirit pool. The air grew heavy and cold as they approached. With a sudden, synchronized push, they thrust her into the murky depths. The water itself seemed to writhe, and though no tangible spirit emerged, an unseen force pulled the Bonga Girl down, her last gasping cries swallowed by the cold, dark embrace of the spirit world, leaving no trace but widening ripples on the surface.\nYet, the spirit of the innocent Bonga Girl refused to be extinguished. From the very spot on the riverbank where her last tear had fallen, a slender shoot of bamboo, vibrant and unusually tall, began to sprout. Nature, a silent witness to her unjust fate, nurtured it with sunlight and rain, allowing it to grow with a miraculous speed and grace. Its hollow joints seemed to hum with a faint, melancholic melody, a living testament to the pure soul that had transfigured, now encased within its emerald green stalks, whispering of what once was.\nA few seasons later, a wandering Jogi, with matted locks and eyes that had seen many lifetimes, chanced upon this remarkable bamboo grove. Drawn by an inexplicable allure, he singled out the tallest, most luminous stalk. As he raised his sharp knife, a faint, almost inaudible plea, like the rustle of leaves in a gentle breeze, seemed to eman emanate from the bamboo, a soft, ethereal sigh. But the Jogi, intent on his craft, dismissed it as the wind's play. He skillfully cut the stalk, then with expert hands, fashioned it into an exquisite fiddle, its wood warm and resonant to his touch.\nThe Jogi, traveling with his wondrous new fiddle, soon arrived at the Chief's village, where a great festival was in full swing. His music, born from the magical bamboo, enchanted all who heard it. The Chief's Family, particularly the elders, became utterly captivated by the instrument's ethereal sound. Desiring its unique magic for themselves, they plied the simple Jogi with potent rice wine and other intoxicating libations until he slumped into a deep, dreamless slumber. Under the cloak of night, they stealthily relieved him of the magical fiddle, spiriting it away to the Chief's palace.\nEach morning, the young Chief's Son awoke to a subtle miracle within his chambers.

As the moon dipped low, a shimmering form, radiant and ethereal, emerged from the magical fiddle. It was a maiden of unparalleled beauty, her eyes holding the depth of ancient sorrow. Gently, the Young Chief spoke her name, extending his hand. Startled, she tried to retreat, but his gentle sincerity held her. With tears in her eyes, she revealed her tragic story: the treachery of her sisters-in-law, her drowning, her reincarnation as the bamboo, and her life within the fiddle. Overwhelmed by her tale and utterly smitten by her pure spirit, the Young Chief declared his love and, with his family's joyous consent, they were wed in a magnificent ceremony.\nNews of the Chief's Son's marriage reached far and wide, eventually drawing the Seven Brothers, accompanied by their Seven Wives, to the Chief's palace for a courtesy visit, entirely unaware of their sister’s astonishing return.
