From the opposite direction, with a flourish of dust and the rhythmic thud of hooves, approached another grand chariot. Seated within was King Mallika of Kosala, a monarch known for his firm and unyielding rule.

The charioteer of Benares, a man of quiet dignity, addressed his counterpart, suggesting they resolve the deadlock by comparing the status of their masters. He inquired about the wealth, lineage, age, and military might of the King of Kosala. Methodically, the two men exchanged details about their kings' kingdoms, their ancestral lines, the extent of their armies, and even their physical age.
