Believing it to be the powerful Kshetradevata, the Guardian Deity of the Field, responsible for the land's fortunes, Haridatta's heart swelled with reverence and a desperate plea. He hurried home, fetched a bowl of cool, fresh milk, and humbly offered it to the majestic serpent, bowing low and imploring for bountiful crops and an end to his family's persistent hardship.\nThe following morning, Haridatta returned to the anthill, and to his astonishment, beside the empty milk bowl, lay a single, gleaming gold coin, reflecting the dawn's first light. Overwhelmed with gratitude and awe, he understood that the Serpent Deity had accepted his offering and blessed him. From that day forward, Haridatta faithfully placed a bowl of milk at the anthill each morning, and without fail, found another precious gold coin in its place. His fortunes steadily rose, and his family, once struggling, began to know comfort and abundance, all thanks to the benevolent Serpent.\nHaridatta's newfound prosperity did not escape the notice of his ambitious and covetous son. The young man, observing his father's daily ritual and the sudden influx of wealth, began to harbor dark thoughts. His mind, clouded by avarice, dismissed the notion of divine generosity. Instead, he concluded with greedy certainty that the entire anthill must be a secret repository of immense gold, and the Serpent was merely a guardian who, once removed, would yield a treasure beyond measure. He began to plot, envisioning himself seizing the entire hoard at once, consumed by a desire that eclipsed all reason and reverence.\nOne day, when Haridatta was away attending a village ceremony, his son, unable to suppress his dark impulses any longer, decided to act. Armed with a heavy club, he crept stealthily towards the sacred anthill. As the majestic Serpent emerged from its dwelling to receive its customary offering, the son struck viciously, aiming a crushing blow at its head. The blow landed, but the resilient Serpent, though injured and enraged by the treacherous attack, was not killed. With a lightning-fast counterstrike born of pain and self-preservation, it sank its venomous fangs deep into the young man's arm. The son shrieked once, then collapsed, the potent venom coursing through his veins, extinguishing his life and his wicked ambitions in a matter of moments.\nWhen Haridatta returned to find his son lifeless beside the anthill, a wave of profound grief washed over him, quickly followed by a chilling understanding of the karmic justice that had unfolded. Despite his sorrow, he knew the fault lay with his son's greed. The next day, with a heavy heart and trembling hands, Haridatta once more placed a bowl of milk before the anthill, hoping to appease the Serpent and salvage their fractured bond. The Serpent emerged, not with the usual placid demeanor, but with sorrow in its eyes, its voice a melancholic hiss. It spoke of how trust, once shattered by such a cruel act, could never truly heal. The pain of the attack, and the subsequent death of Haridatta's own blood, had created an unbridgeable chasm between them, making their previous relationship an impossibility.\nAs a final, poignant gesture, the Serpent glided gracefully from its mound, depositing a magnificent, lustrous pearl at Haridatta's feet. \"Take this, Haridatta,\" it hissed, its voice imbued with profound sadness. \"It is the last gift from a bond that was once pure but is now stained by human avarice. The path of gold coins is closed to you forever. The pain and mistrust caused by your son's actions run too deep. Depart from this field, carry the weight of this lesson in your heart, and never seek my presence again.\" With a final, mournful glance, the Guardian Deity of the Field retreated into the ancient anthill, leaving Haridatta alone with the shimmering pearl, a poignant reminder of both generosity and the devastating cost of greed.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Haridatta\"], \"receivers\": [\"The Serpent\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"The Serpent\", \"alias\": \"Guardian Deity of the Field\", \"archetype\": \"Other\"}, {\"name\": \"Haridatta\", \"alias\": \"The Brahman\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

From that day forward, Haridatta faithfully placed a bowl of milk at the anthill each morning, and without fail, found another precious gold coin in its place. His fortunes steadily rose, and his family, once struggling, began to know comfort and abundance, all thanks to the benevolent Serpent.\nHaridatta's newfound prosperity did not escape the notice of his ambitious and covetous son. The young man, observing his father's daily ritual and the sudden influx of wealth, began to harbor dark thoughts. His mind, clouded by avarice, dismissed the notion of divine generosity. Instead, he concluded with greedy certainty that the entire anthill must be a secret repository of immense gold, and the Serpent was merely a guardian who, once removed, would yield a treasure beyond measure. He began to plot, envisioning himself seizing the entire hoard at once, consumed by a desire that eclipsed all reason and reverence.\nOne day, when Haridatta was away attending a village ceremony, his son, unable to suppress his dark impulses any longer, decided to act. Armed with a heavy club, he crept stealthily towards the sacred anthill. As the majestic Serpent emerged from its dwelling to receive its customary offering, the son struck viciously, aiming a crushing blow at its head. The blow landed, but the resilient Serpent, though injured and enraged by the treacherous attack, was not killed. With a lightning-fast counterstrike born of pain and self-preservation, it sank its venomous fangs deep into the young man's arm. The son shrieked once, then collapsed, the potent venom coursing through his veins, extinguishing his life and his wicked ambitions in a matter of moments.\nWhen Haridatta returned to find his son lifeless beside the anthill, a wave of profound grief washed over him, quickly followed by a chilling understanding of the karmic justice that had unfolded. Despite his sorrow, he knew the fault lay with his son's greed. The next day, with a heavy heart and trembling hands, Haridatta once more placed a bowl of milk before the anthill, hoping to appease the Serpent and salvage their fractured bond. The Serpent emerged, not with the usual placid demeanor, but with sorrow in its eyes, its voice a melancholic hiss. It spoke of how trust, once shattered by such a cruel act, could never truly heal. The pain of the attack, and the subsequent death of Haridatta's own blood, had created an unbridgeable chasm between them, making their previous relationship an impossibility.\nAs a final, poignant gesture, the Serpent glided gracefully from its mound, depositing a magnificent, lustrous pearl at Haridatta's feet. \"Take this, Haridatta,\" it hissed, its voice imbued with profound sadness. \"It is the last gift from a bond that was once pure but is now stained by human avarice. The path of gold coins is closed to you forever. The pain and mistrust caused by your son's actions run too deep. Depart from this field, carry the weight of this lesson in your heart, and never seek my presence again.\" With a final, mournful glance, the Guardian Deity of the Field retreated into the ancient anthill, leaving Haridatta alone with the shimmering pearl, a poignant reminder of both generosity and the devastating cost of greed.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"The Serpent\"], \"receivers\": [\"Haridatta\"], \"new_characters\": [], \"notes\": \"\"}"}
