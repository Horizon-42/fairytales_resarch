His harvests were meager, his family often hungry, while the Money-lender, Sethji, grew fatter and richer each year, his mansion looming over the humble huts. One day, desperation gnawing at his heart, Govind approached Sethji, his voice meek yet earnest. \"Oh, revered Sethji,\" he pleaded, bowing low, \"you possess such immense wealth and fortune. Would you, in your boundless generosity, reveal to me the secret to becoming prosperous?\"\n\nSummary:\nGovind, a poor farmer, seeks wealth from the greedy Sethji, who directs him to seek divine blessing from Lord Ram. After a journey, Govind encounters Ram, who grants him a magical conch to fulfill wishes.

Only God, Ram himself, can grant such a boon. Go, find Ram, and beg him for it.\" Taking the Money-lender's sarcastic advice as a genuine truth, Govind, a man of simple faith, felt a flicker of hope. He gathered his meager possessions—a worn dhoti, a small clay pot for water, and a few handfuls of dried millet—and, bidding his tearful family farewell, embarked on a solitary journey towards the distant mountains, believing he could truly find the Lord Ram there.\n\nSummary:\nGovind, a poor farmer, seeks wealth from the greedy Sethji, who directs him to seek divine blessing from Lord Ram.

Though Govind himself was famished, down to his very last handful of precious millet, his compassionate heart overtook his hunger.

Ram, his voice resonating like a celestial melody, smiled warmly. \"O pious farmer,\" he declared, \"your selfless compassion has moved me deeply.
