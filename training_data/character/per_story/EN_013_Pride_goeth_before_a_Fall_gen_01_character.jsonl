The robbers, with ruthless efficiency, stripped every man of his precious wares, coin purses, and even the very clothes off their backs, leaving them shivering and destitute beneath the harsh sun.\nFlushed with their easy victory and the intoxicating sense of absolute power, the Three Robbers, who now fancied themselves \"three monarchs\" of this desolate stretch, found grim amusement in their victims' plight. They guzzled potent bhang from the merchants’ own recovered flasks, their laughter echoing cruelly across the barren landscape. \"What, no celebration, you naked wretches?\" one robber boomed, brandishing a stolen dagger. \"Dance for your lives! Show us some entertainment, or we shall find our own, far less pleasant, ways to amuse ourselves!\" The terrified merchants, humiliation burning their faces, began to shuffle and sway awkwardly, their spirits crushed, their bodies exposed to the jeering mockery of their captors.\nAs the merchants performed their sorrowful, impromptu dance, the Clever Merchant, his mind a whirlwind of despair and defiance, noticed the robbers growing increasingly inebriated and complacent. He stepped forward, raising his voice above the crude jeers. \"Friends, let us lighten our hearts with an old Traders' song, a ditty from the bustling bazaars!\" he declared, and began to sing in a melodic, deceptively simple tune. His song, however, was laced with the familiar, rhythmic jargon of the cloth trade: \"Erith, enty, eno, the fabric is loose, erith, enty, eno, a knot to tie tight! Erith, enty, eno, strike when the moment is right, erith, enty, eno, take hold with all might!\" To the robbers, it was mere gibberish, an exotic accompaniment to their drunken revelry, but to the Ten Cloth Merchants, a flicker of understanding ignited in their eyes.\nWith newfound resolve, spurred by the Clever Merchant's subtle commands hidden within the seemingly innocent song, the Ten Cloth Merchants moved with a sudden, coordinated ferocity. As the Leader sang the final, emphatic 'Erith, enty, eno, bind them up tight!', the traders, no longer helpless victims, sprang into action. They lunged at the astonished Three Robbers, using their collective strength. One robber, still reeling from the unexpected assault, stumbled over his own feet, another found his arms pinned by two determined merchants, and the third was wrestled to the ground. The struggle was brief but fierce, fueled by the merchants' pent-up fear and indignation, and within moments, the Notorious robbers lay subdued, their own loincloths and turbans used to bind their hands and feet securely.\nOnce their adversaries were helpless, the Ten Cloth Merchants, with the Clever Merchant directing them, swiftly recovered all their stolen wealth, their vibrant garments, and their precious textiles from the robbers' crude hideout nearby. Their hearts swelled not just with relief, but with a profound sense of triumph. They left the bound robbers to face justice from the passing authorities and, adorned once more in their magnificent wares, continued their journey home.
