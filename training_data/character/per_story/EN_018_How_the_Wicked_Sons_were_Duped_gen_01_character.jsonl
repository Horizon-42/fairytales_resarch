As age began to settle upon his shoulders like a heavy shawl, he decided, in a moment of trusting love, to divide his considerable wealth – his fertile lands, a chest of precious jewels, and bags of gleaming gold coins – among his two robust young sons, Ravi and Suresh. He envisioned a peaceful retirement, cared for by his grateful offspring. However, no sooner had the last deed been signed and the last coin counted than the sons, revealing their true, wretched natures, transformed into selfish ingrates. The Old Man's comforts vanished; his warm meals became meager scraps, his soft bed a cold mat, and his pleas for kindness were met with harsh words and cold stares. He was a burden, neglected and abused, left to languish in a corner of his own former home, his heart heavy with bitter regret.\n\nSummary:\nGopal, an elderly man, divides his wealth between his greedy sons, Ravi and Suresh, only to be neglected and abused after their betrayal. His loyal friend Rama deceives them into believing hidden treasure exists, manipulating their greed to secure Gopal's comfort. The sons, fooled into revering their father, later dig futilely for the supposed treasure, uncovering only emptiness. Their selfishness leads to their downfall, as they realize their father outwitted them, leaving them with ruin and regret.\n\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"The Sons\"], \"receivers\": [\"The Old Man\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"The Old Man\", \"alias\": \"Father; Poor Old Man\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"}, {\"name\": \"The Sons\", \"alias\": \"Wretched, selfish ingrates; Young men\", \"archetype\": \"Villain\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

Rama, a man whose eyes held the sparkle of ancient wisdom and whose heart harbored a deep affection for Gopal, had heard whispers of the sons’ cruelty. Approaching with a conspiratorial air, Rama carried two stout jute bags, purposefully heavy and clinking with the sound of many small stones, a sound he took care to amplify. In a voice loud enough to carry through the open windows to where Ravi and Suresh sat scheming, Rama declared, \"Gopal, my dear friend! It is a blessing you confided in me years ago to secure your true fortune, the hidden gold and gems, in a secret place on this very land! These bags are but a fraction, a mere distraction, for the vast treasure that awaits!\" He winked subtly at Gopal, who, despite his weakened state, caught the glint of a cunning plan in his friend’s eye.\n\nSummary:\nGopal, an elderly man, divides his wealth between his greedy sons, Ravi and Suresh, only to be neglected and abused after their betrayal.

Their avarice, once directed at their father’s initial wealth, now fixated on this tantalizing, hidden hoard. With astonishing speed, their cruel neglect was replaced by exaggerated reverence. They bathed the Old Man with scented water, brought him sumptuous meals served on shining brass plates, draped him in soft, freshly laundered kurtas, and spoke to him with unctuous politeness, inquiring about his health and comfort with feigned filial devotion. Gopal, understanding the game, played his part masterfully. He would smile faintly, hint at a \"special place\" known only to him, or speak of \"the right time\" to reveal the treasure, keeping his sons enthralled and ensuring his own comfort for the remaining days of his life, observing their transparent trickery with a quiet, knowing amusement.\n\nSummary:\nGopal, an elderly man, divides his wealth between his greedy sons, Ravi and Suresh, only to be neglected and abused after their betrayal.

His sons, Ravi and Suresh, performed the funeral rites with an extravagant show of grief, though their minds were fixated solely on the imminent unveiling of the hidden treasure. No sooner were the ceremonies concluded than the wretched, selfish ingrates armed themselves with spades and shovels. They fell upon the ancestral land with a furious energy, digging relentlessly, turning over every clod of earth, uprooting ancient trees, and demolishing old stone walls. For days they toiled, their greed pushing them onward, until the once-fertile plot resembled a battlefield of craters and overturned soil. But all they unearthed was rock and common earth. The horrifying realization, a bitter and crushing truth, finally dawned upon them: there was no gold, no gems, only the vast emptiness of their own folly. They had been duped, tricked by their own father, and the only treasure they had secured was a ruined field and the agonizing knowledge that their greed had been their undoing, a punishment they had inflicted upon themselves.\n\nSummary:\nGopal, an elderly man, divides his wealth between his greedy sons, Ravi and Suresh, only to be neglected and abused after their betrayal.
