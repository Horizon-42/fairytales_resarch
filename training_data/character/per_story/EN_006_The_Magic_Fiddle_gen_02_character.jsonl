The seven wives, consumed by envy of the sister’s radiant beauty and her brothers’ affection, convened in hushed whispers beneath the ancient banyan tree. Their hearts, dark with malice, brewed a sinister plot to rid themselves of her. They decided to offer her as a sacrifice to the dreaded forest Bonga, a spirit known to dwell in the darkest thickets, hoping it would claim her forever and erase her from their lives.\nFeigning sweetness, the seven wives lured the unsuspecting Bonga Girl to a secluded, eerie pool deep within the jungle, a place whispered to be the abode of the fearsome Bonga. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long, menacing shadows, the wives pushed the screaming girl into the murky waters. The air grew heavy, and a chilling presence emerged from the depths, a shadowy hand reaching out to pull her down. Despite her desperate pleas and struggles, the Bonga snatched her, dragging her into its spectral realm, her life extinguished, her body vanishing without a trace into the spirit world.\nHowever, the purity of the Bonga Girl’s spirit could not be confined to the realm of the dead. Nature, witness to her unjust demise, nurtured her essence. From the very spot where her innocent tears had mingled with the sacred earth near the pool, a slender shoot of bamboo began to sprout. It grew swiftly, taller and more vibrant than any other cane in the forest, its hollow heart resonating with a faint, sorrowful melody, a testament to the soul that now dwelled within its woody sheath.\nMany seasons later, a wandering Jogi, an ascetic with matted locks and eyes that saw beyond the veil, chanced upon the magnificent bamboo grove. He was drawn to the unique cane, hearing a faint, almost inaudible lament emanating from it. Despite a strange tremor in his soul and the subtle pleas that seemed to whisper on the wind, he disregarded the uneasy feeling. With his sharp knife, he carefully cut the exquisite bamboo, taking it back to his humble dwelling. With skilled hands and reverence for the material, he crafted it into a beautiful, resonant fiddle, its wood gleaming like polished amber.\nThe Jogi, enchanted by the melodious tones that flowed from the fiddle, carried its music throughout the land. His fame reached the ears of the local Chief, who invited him to his grand palace. There, amidst the Chief's family, the Jogi played tunes that stirred the soul. But the Chief’s family, captivated by the fiddle's magic and desiring it for their own, concocted a deceitful plan. They offered the Jogi strong, potent intoxicating drink, ensuring he would fall into a deep, heavy slumber. Under the cover of night, while the Jogi lay unconscious, they pilfered the magical fiddle, leaving him to wake to a profound sense of loss.\nThe Chief's son, the young Chief, was particularly enamored with the stolen fiddle and kept it in his personal chambers. He noticed, however, a peculiar occurrence: every morning, his room was immaculately tidy, his clothes neatly folded, and fresh, delicious meals awaited him, though no servant had entered. Intrigued, he observed these secret domestic duties, a hidden hand bringing order and comfort to his life, all while the magical fiddle lay silently on his bed, its secret guardian unseen and unknown.\nOne evening, determined to unravel the mystery, the young Chief hid himself in his chambers. As the moon rose, he watched in astonishment as a beautiful maiden, radiant as the dawn, emerged from the magical fiddle. As she began her chores, he sprang from his hiding place and, with gentle hands, caught her, preventing her swift return to the instrument. Overwhelmed but seeing his sincere gaze, the Bonga Girl revealed her tragic past, her transformation, and her heart's desire for a life free of sorrow. Captivated by her story and her grace, the young Chief, without hesitation, asked for her hand in marriage, and their union was celebrated with joyous festivities, filling the palace with drumbeats and melodic songs.\nYears later, the Chief's Seven Brothers, now older and perhaps burdened by unspoken guilt, visited the Chief’s palace, unaware of their sister’s fate. As they were presented to the Chief's beautiful daughter-in-law, the former Bonga Girl, a wave of recognition, then deep shame, washed over them. She, now a revered lady, calmly addressed them. Holding the magical fiddle, she recounted her harrowing tale of betrayal and suffering, her voice echoing with the instrument’s plaintive melody. The brothers stood humbled and distraught, confronted by the living testament of their wives’ cruelty and their own negligence, forced to face the consequence of their silent complicity.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Seven Wives\"], \"receivers\": [\"Bonga Girl\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"Bonga Girl\", \"alias\": \"sister\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"}, {\"name\": \"Seven Wives\", \"alias\": \"Sisters-in-law\", \"archetype\": \"Villain\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

He noticed, however, a peculiar occurrence: every morning, his room was immaculately tidy, his clothes neatly folded, and fresh, delicious meals awaited him, though no servant had entered. Intrigued, he observed these secret domestic duties, a hidden hand bringing order and comfort to his life, all while the magical fiddle lay silently on his bed, its secret guardian unseen and unknown.\n\nSummary:\n\n\nExisting Characters:\n- Bonga Girl (aliases: sister)\n- Seven Wives (aliases: Sisters-in-law)\n- nature\n- The Jogi\n- Chief's Family\n\n\n\nFull Story Context:\nIn a small village nestled on the edge of the deep jungle, lived seven brothers, each with a wife, and their innocent young sister, known simply as the Bonga Girl for her gentle, ethereal nature. The seven wives, consumed by envy of the sister’s radiant beauty and her brothers’ affection, convened in hushed whispers beneath the ancient banyan tree. Their hearts, dark with malice, brewed a sinister plot to rid themselves of her. They decided to offer her as a sacrifice to the dreaded forest Bonga, a spirit known to dwell in the darkest thickets, hoping it would claim her forever and erase her from their lives.\nFeigning sweetness, the seven wives lured the unsuspecting Bonga Girl to a secluded, eerie pool deep within the jungle, a place whispered to be the abode of the fearsome Bonga. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long, menacing shadows, the wives pushed the screaming girl into the murky waters. The air grew heavy, and a chilling presence emerged from the depths, a shadowy hand reaching out to pull her down. Despite her desperate pleas and struggles, the Bonga snatched her, dragging her into its spectral realm, her life extinguished, her body vanishing without a trace into the spirit world.\nHowever, the purity of the Bonga Girl’s spirit could not be confined to the realm of the dead. Nature, witness to her unjust demise, nurtured her essence. From the very spot where her innocent tears had mingled with the sacred earth near the pool, a slender shoot of bamboo began to sprout. It grew swiftly, taller and more vibrant than any other cane in the forest, its hollow heart resonating with a faint, sorrowful melody, a testament to the soul that now dwelled within its woody sheath.\nMany seasons later, a wandering Jogi, an ascetic with matted locks and eyes that saw beyond the veil, chanced upon the magnificent bamboo grove. He was drawn to the unique cane, hearing a faint, almost inaudible lament emanating from it. Despite a strange tremor in his soul and the subtle pleas that seemed to whisper on the wind, he disregarded the uneasy feeling. With his sharp knife, he carefully cut the exquisite bamboo, taking it back to his humble dwelling. With skilled hands and reverence for the material, he crafted it into a beautiful, resonant fiddle, its wood gleaming like polished amber.\nThe Jogi, enchanted by the melodious tones that flowed from the fiddle, carried its music throughout the land. His fame reached the ears of the local Chief, who invited him to his grand palace. There, amidst the Chief's family, the Jogi played tunes that stirred the soul. But the Chief’s family, captivated by the fiddle's magic and desiring it for their own, concocted a deceitful plan. They offered the Jogi strong, potent intoxicating drink, ensuring he would fall into a deep, heavy slumber. Under the cover of night, while the Jogi lay unconscious, they pilfered the magical fiddle, leaving him to wake to a profound sense of loss.\nThe Chief's son, the young Chief, was particularly enamored with the stolen fiddle and kept it in his personal chambers.

Intrigued, he observed these secret domestic duties, a hidden hand bringing order and comfort to his life, all while the magical fiddle lay silently on his bed, its secret guardian unseen and unknown.\nOne evening, determined to unravel the mystery, the young Chief hid himself in his chambers. As the moon rose, he watched in astonishment as a beautiful maiden, radiant as the dawn, emerged from the magical fiddle. As she began her chores, he sprang from his hiding place and, with gentle hands, caught her, preventing her swift return to the instrument. Overwhelmed but seeing his sincere gaze, the Bonga Girl revealed her tragic past, her transformation, and her heart's desire for a life free of sorrow. Captivated by her story and her grace, the young Chief, without hesitation, asked for her hand in marriage, and their union was celebrated with joyous festivities, filling the palace with drumbeats and melodic songs.\nYears later, the Chief's Seven Brothers, now older and perhaps burdened by unspoken guilt, visited the Chief’s palace, unaware of their sister’s fate. As they were presented to the Chief's beautiful daughter-in-law, the former Bonga Girl, a wave of recognition, then deep shame, washed over them. She, now a revered lady, calmly addressed them.
