The air was thick with the aroma of cardamoms, saffron, and roasted spices, and platters laden with the richest delicacies, sweet laddoos, and fragrant curries stretched as far as the eye could see. Sun, the Eldest, with his boisterous hunger, devoured every morsel he could reach, thinking only of his own satisfaction. Wind, equally unrestrained, swept through the dishes, tasting and consuming without a moment's pause. But Gentle Moon, the Daughter, with her quiet grace and ever-thoughtful heart, carefully wrapped a small parcel of the finest sweets and a portion of fragrant rice in a fresh banana leaf, intending to bring it home for their dear Mother, Star, who had stayed behind to watch over the universe.\n\nSummary:\nIn a celestial realm, Sun, Moon, and Wind, children of Star, attend a lavish feast hosted by their uncle and aunts. While Sun and Wind indulge selfishly, Moon remembers to save a gift for their absent mother, Star. Upon returning, Star reveals that Sun and Wind’s neglect transforms them into scorching sunlight and harsh winds, while Moon becomes the gentle, comforting moon. The story underscores the consequences of selfishness versus selflessness, shaping the natural elements as eternal reflections of their choices.\n\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"Moon\"], \"receivers\": [\"Star\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"Star\", \"alias\": \"Mother\", \"archetype\": \"Other\"}, {\"name\": \"Moon\", \"alias\": \"Daughter; Gentle Moon\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}
