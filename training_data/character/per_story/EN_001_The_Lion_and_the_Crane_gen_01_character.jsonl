He dwelled by a tranquil lotus pond, his days spent in quiet contemplation and gentle service to the natural world. His heart was filled with boundless compassion and a serene understanding of the interconnectedness of all life, qualities that would one day blossom into the perfect enlightenment of Gautama the Buddha.\nNot far from the Bodhisatta’s peaceful abode reigned a powerful and fearsome Lion, known as Devadatta, whose roar alone sent shivers through the jungle. One sweltering afternoon, after a particularly ravenous feast, a large, sharp bone lodged itself deep in the Lion’s throat. The pain was excruciating, a fiery torment that prevented him from swallowing even water, let alone hunting. His mighty roars turned into desperate gurgles, and his strength began to wane as hunger and agony consumed him.\nThe tormented Lion's piteous cries echoed through the forest, a sound so unnatural it caught the attention of the compassionate White Crane. Approaching with cautious steps, Bodhisatta observed the suffering beast. Seeing the Lion’s dire predicament, the White Crane, ever benevolent, offered his aid. \"O King of the Jungle,\" he called out, his voice clear and steady, \"I can free you from this torment, but only if you swear upon your roar that you will not harm me.\" The desperate Lion, through gritted teeth, nodded vigorously, promising safety in exchange for relief.\nTrusting in the Lion’s word, yet ever wise and prudent, Bodhisatta sought a sturdy branch. He carefully inserted one end into the Lion's gaping maw, wedging it crosswise to ensure the fearsome jaws could not snap shut unexpectedly. Then, with his long, delicate beak, the White Crane meticulously probed the Lion’s throat, located the offending bone, and with a swift, practiced motion, extracted it. The Lion, gasping in sudden relief, felt the immediate cessation of his torment.\nWith the bone now lying harmlessly on the forest floor, the Lion stretched his neck, his throat finally clear. Bodhisatta, instead of simply departing, paused. He looked directly into the restored Lion's eyes and asked gently, \"O mighty Lion, I risked my life to alleviate your immense suffering and restore your health. What recompense or token of gratitude do you offer to your rescuer for such a perilous service?\" It was a test of the Lion's character, a gentle nudge towards dharma.\nThe Lion, however, quickly forgot his recent agony and the compassion that had saved him. His true, ungrateful nature resurfaced. He glared at the White Crane with haughty disdain. \"Reward?\" he scoffed, his voice a low, menacing growl. \"Foolish bird! Is it not reward enough that I, the undisputed King of this jungle, the mighty Devadatta, have spared your life? You stand before me whole and unharmed, a rare privilege indeed. Begone, before I change my mind!\"\nBodhisatta, the White Crane, heard the Lion's words with a sorrowful wisdom. He understood that such a heart, devoid of gratitude and compassion, could never truly appreciate kindness. \"Indeed, O Lion,\" he replied, his voice tinged with regret but unwavering, \"your ingratitude is your own burden. One who acts with virtue should expect no such reciprocation from a heart as dark as yours. Your character is your true reward.\" With these solemn words, the noble White Crane spread his broad wings and ascended gracefully into the sky, leaving the unrepentant Lion to his self-serving ways, ensuring his own safety from such treachery.\nWhen the Great Teacher, Gautama the Buddha, recounted this ancient tale to his assembly of monks and lay followers, he concluded with profound insight. \"Understand, my disciples,\" he revealed to the Reader, \"that the compassionate White Crane of that time was none other than I, the Bodhisatta, in a former incarnation, striving always towards selfless virtue.

He dwelled by a tranquil lotus pond, his days spent in quiet contemplation and gentle service to the natural world. His heart was filled with boundless compassion and a serene understanding of the interconnectedness of all life, qualities that would one day blossom into the perfect enlightenment of Gautama the Buddha.\nNot far from the Bodhisatta’s peaceful abode reigned a powerful and fearsome Lion, known as Devadatta, whose roar alone sent shivers through the jungle. One sweltering afternoon, after a particularly ravenous feast, a large, sharp bone lodged itself deep in the Lion’s throat. The pain was excruciating, a fiery torment that prevented him from swallowing even water, let alone hunting. His mighty roars turned into desperate gurgles, and his strength began to wane as hunger and agony consumed him.\nThe tormented Lion's piteous cries echoed through the forest, a sound so unnatural it caught the attention of the compassionate White Crane. Approaching with cautious steps, Bodhisatta observed the suffering beast. Seeing the Lion’s dire predicament, the White Crane, ever benevolent, offered his aid. \"O King of the Jungle,\" he called out, his voice clear and steady, \"I can free you from this torment, but only if you swear upon your roar that you will not harm me.\" The desperate Lion, through gritted teeth, nodded vigorously, promising safety in exchange for relief.\nTrusting in the Lion’s word, yet ever wise and prudent, Bodhisatta sought a sturdy branch. He carefully inserted one end into the Lion's gaping maw, wedging it crosswise to ensure the fearsome jaws could not snap shut unexpectedly. Then, with his long, delicate beak, the White Crane meticulously probed the Lion’s throat, located the offending bone, and with a swift, practiced motion, extracted it. The Lion, gasping in sudden relief, felt the immediate cessation of his torment.\nWith the bone now lying harmlessly on the forest floor, the Lion stretched his neck, his throat finally clear. Bodhisatta, instead of simply departing, paused.
