This garrulousness often left his ministers, including his wise adviser, the Bodisat—who was the Future Buddha—weary and unable to present urgent matters effectively. The Bodisat observed this with quiet concern, knowing that a king's words held great weight and should be carefully considered, not carelessly scattered like grains of sand.\nFar away, near a tranquil lotus pond, lived two splendid Hamsas, wild ducks with feathers like polished silver, who were the closest companions to a talkative Tortoise. As the hot season intensified, their beloved pond began to shrink, its once-lush lilies wilting under the sun. The Hamsas, recalling the abundant waters and sweet fruits of the Golden Cave in the distant Himalayas, decided it was time to migrate. They shared their plans with their friend, the Tortoise, who lamented his inability to join them in the sky, expressing deep sorrow at the thought of being left behind by his cherished companions.\nMoved by the Tortoise’s despair, the two Hamsas devised a clever solution. \"Friend Tortoise,\" one Wild Duck announced, \"we shall carry you to the Golden Cave! We will each hold an end of a sturdy stick in our beaks, and you must grasp the middle of the stick firmly with your mouth.\" The other Hamsa then added, with solemn gravity, \"However, there is one absolute, non-negotiable condition, dear friend: you must not, under any circumstance, open your mouth to speak a single word. Should you utter even a syllable, you will lose your grip and fall to your doom. Do you promise to remain utterly silent throughout the journey?\" The Tortoise, overjoyed and eager for adventure, readily agreed, promising with all his heart to keep his mouth shut tight.\nWith the ingenious plan finalized, the two Hamsas found a strong, straight stick. Each wild duck took one end of the stick firmly in its beak, their powerful wings ready for the long journey. The Tortoise, with a determined grip, clamped his jaws around the middle of the stick. With a synchronized beat of their wings, they lifted off the drying pond, ascending gracefully into the vast, azure sky. Below them, the familiar landscape of trees, rivers, and fields began to shrink, and the Tortoise felt a thrill of wonder and excitement as they soared higher and higher, heading northward towards the majestic peaks of the Himalayas.\nAs the extraordinary trio flew high above the land, they passed over a bustling village where people were going about their daily chores. Suddenly, a group of villagers looked up, their eyes widening in disbelief at the sight. \"Look!\" exclaimed one villager, pointing towards the sky, \"Two wild ducks are carrying a tortoise on a stick!\" Another laughed, \"What a marvelous sight! I have never witnessed such a wonder!\" Their astonished comments and excited murmurs drifted up, catching the attention of the Tortoise, whose natural inclination to speak was greatly stirred by the unexpected public display of his unique aerial journey.\nThe Tortoise, a creature of inherent garrulousness, found the villagers' comments utterly irresistible. Swelling with a mixture of pride and a desire to clarify or perhaps even boast about his ingenious mode of transport, he completely forgot the solemn promise he had made to his wild duck friends. Unable to hold his tongue for even another moment, he opened his mouth wide to speak, intending to address the villagers below. In that instant, his grip on the stick vanished, and with a gasp of sudden terror, he plummeted from the immense height, crashing onto the hard earth below, where he perished instantly.\nWhen the two Hamsas, filled with sorrow, recounted the tragic tale of their talkative friend's demise to the King's Adviser, the Bodisat, he saw a profound lesson. Later, during a royal audience, the Bodisat humbly addressed King Brahma-datta, who, true to form, was in the midst of a lengthy monologue. \"Your Majesty,\" the Teacher interjected gently, \"those who talk too much, like the ill-fated tortoise, often bring about their own destruction. Speech, though a gift, can be a dangerous weapon if wielded without thought. The tortoise perished because he could not control his tongue, just as a king who speaks incessantly risks losing his wisdom and the respect of his subjects.\"\nKing Brahma-datta, initially taken aback by the directness of the Bodisat’s words and the tragic parable, felt a profound chill of understanding penetrate his heart. He envisioned the Tortoise's fatal fall and recognized, with a jolt, the reflection of his own unchecked loquaciousness. The wisdom of the Bodisat resonated deeply within him, revealing the potential pitfalls of his own excessive talking. From that day forward, the King resolved to internalize the bitter lesson of the Talkative Tortoise. He became a monarch renowned not for the quantity of his words, but for their quality and thoughtful silence, transforming himself into a truly wise and respected ruler.\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"The King\"], \"receivers\": [\"The Future Buddha\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"The Future Buddha\", \"alias\": \"The King's Adviser; The Bodisat; Teacher\", \"archetype\": \"Mentor\"}, {\"name\": \"The King\", \"alias\": \"Brahma-datta\", \"archetype\": \"Ruler\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}

His royal council meetings often stretched for hours, not due to complex state matters, but because the King would digress into endless anecdotes, opinions, and pronouncements, often repeating himself. This garrulousness often left his ministers, including his wise adviser, the Bodisat—who was the Future Buddha—weary and unable to present urgent matters effectively. The Bodisat observed this with quiet concern, knowing that a king's words held great weight and should be carefully considered, not carelessly scattered like grains of sand.\nFar away, near a tranquil lotus pond, lived two splendid Hamsas, wild ducks with feathers like polished silver, who were the closest companions to a talkative Tortoise. As the hot season intensified, their beloved pond began to shrink, its once-lush lilies wilting under the sun. The Hamsas, recalling the abundant waters and sweet fruits of the Golden Cave in the distant Himalayas, decided it was time to migrate. They shared their plans with their friend, the Tortoise, who lamented his inability to join them in the sky, expressing deep sorrow at the thought of being left behind by his cherished companions.\nMoved by the Tortoise’s despair, the two Hamsas devised a clever solution. \"Friend Tortoise,\" one Wild Duck announced, \"we shall carry you to the Golden Cave! We will each hold an end of a sturdy stick in our beaks, and you must grasp the middle of the stick firmly with your mouth.\" The other Hamsa then added, with solemn gravity, \"However, there is one absolute, non-negotiable condition, dear friend: you must not, under any circumstance, open your mouth to speak a single word. Should you utter even a syllable, you will lose your grip and fall to your doom. Do you promise to remain utterly silent throughout the journey?\" The Tortoise, overjoyed and eager for adventure, readily agreed, promising with all his heart to keep his mouth shut tight.\nWith the ingenious plan finalized, the two Hamsas found a strong, straight stick. Each wild duck took one end of the stick firmly in its beak, their powerful wings ready for the long journey. The Tortoise, with a determined grip, clamped his jaws around the middle of the stick. With a synchronized beat of their wings, they lifted off the drying pond, ascending gracefully into the vast, azure sky. Below them, the familiar landscape of trees, rivers, and fields began to shrink, and the Tortoise felt a thrill of wonder and excitement as they soared higher and higher, heading northward towards the majestic peaks of the Himalayas.\nAs the extraordinary trio flew high above the land, they passed over a bustling village where people were going about their daily chores. Suddenly, a group of villagers looked up, their eyes widening in disbelief at the sight. \"Look!\" exclaimed one villager, pointing towards the sky, \"Two wild ducks are carrying a tortoise on a stick!\" Another laughed, \"What a marvelous sight! I have never witnessed such a wonder!\" Their astonished comments and excited murmurs drifted up, catching the attention of the Tortoise, whose natural inclination to speak was greatly stirred by the unexpected public display of his unique aerial journey.\nThe Tortoise, a creature of inherent garrulousness, found the villagers' comments utterly irresistible.
