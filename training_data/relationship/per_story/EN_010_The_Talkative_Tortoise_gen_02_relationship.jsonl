His court often stretched late into the night, not due to complex affairs of state, but because the King would hold forth on every conceivable subject, leaving his ministers exhausted and pressing matters delayed. The King's Adviser, a revered sage known as The Future Buddha, observed this with quiet concern, recognizing that this garrulous habit, though seemingly harmless, was a significant impediment to true wisdom and efficient governance.
