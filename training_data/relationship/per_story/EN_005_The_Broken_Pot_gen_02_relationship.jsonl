His mind, unburdened by the day's trivialities, began to spin an elaborate tapestry of future fortune. \"This rice,\" he mused to himself, \"will multiply. I shall sell it for a handsome sum, and with that money, I will purchase more rice, and then still more. Soon, I shall have a warehouse brimming with grains, and from its sale, I shall acquire a herd of cattle, then horses, and finally, vast tracts of land. I, Svabhavakripana, shall become a merchant king, lauded throughout the land for my immense wealth!\"\n\nSummary:\nSvabhavakripana, a miserly Brahman, hoards a small amount of rice in a pot, imagining it will grow into vast wealth and power. His fantasies of becoming a merchant king and controlling his family lead him to impulsively kick the pot, shattering it and losing his rice. The tale warns against unrealistic ambitions and neglecting the present, as his greed and overreach destroy his meager possessions.
