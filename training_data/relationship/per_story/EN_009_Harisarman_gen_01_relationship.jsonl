Harisarman, a man of humble means, and his quiet wife sat in a corner, their stomachs rumbling more from the fragrant aromas than from actual food. While plates piled high with sweetmeats and delicacies passed by, only the barest scraps and watery lentil soup reached their meager platters. The sting of their poverty was sharp, but the disrespect, the utter disregard from Sthuladatta and his other wealthy guests, wounded Harisarman's pride far more deeply than any hunger.\nBurning with the humiliation of that night, Harisarman confided in his wife, vowing to shed the shackles of disrespect. A cunning plan began to form in his mind. Under the cloak of the deepest night, he slipped into Sthuladatta’s stables, his heart pounding a rhythm against his ribs. With practiced stealth, Harisarman unlatched the stall of the householder's most magnificent steed, a swift, black mare, leading it away to a secluded thicket far from the village, intending to \"discover\" it later through a fabricated act of divination.\nThe following dawn found Sthuladatta in a frenzy of despair over his missing horse. Harisarman, meanwhile, had subtly allowed whispers of his newfound 'divine sight' to circulate. Approaching the distraught householder, Harisarman feigned a trance, his eyes rolling back as he muttered ancient-sounding incantations. With a dramatic flourish, he declared the horse was not stolen by thieves but had wandered into a specific, distant grove. When Sthuladatta’s men rushed to the spot and miraculously found the mare, Harisarman's reputation as a profound sage spread throughout the land like wildfire.\nNews of Harisarman's miraculous powers soon reached the ears of the King himself. When the royal treasury suffered a daring theft, the King, desperate for a solution, immediately summoned the famed sage. Harisarman, now known far and wide, stood before the majestic monarch, his heart a frantic drum against his ribs. The King commanded him to use his divine sight to locate the stolen wealth. Harisarman felt the chilling trap of his own escalating lies, aware that his previous success was pure fortune, and this time, his fate truly hung by a thread, especially under the cynical gaze of the Minister, Devajnanin.\nThat night, alone in the opulent chambers provided by the King, Harisarman was a wreck of nerves, pacing like a caged tiger. \"Oh, Jihva,\" he groaned, running a hand through his hair, \"My wretched tongue, you have spoken me into this impossible predicament!\" His lament was not unheard. Unbeknownst to him, a palace attendant, a woman named Jihva who served in the King’s household, and who was, in fact, one of the culprits behind the royal theft, happened to be passing by. Overhearing Harisarman’s distraught utterance, Jihva gasped, believing the sage had divined her very name and her crime. Terrified and guilt-ridden, she immediately sought Harisarman and tearfully confessed everything, pleading for mercy.\nArmed with the precise details of Jihva’s confession, Harisarman presented himself before the King the next morning, radiating an aura of serene confidence. He dramatically revealed the exact hiding place of the royal treasure, describing the concealed alcove and the peculiar markings on the chest, all while carefully concealing the identity of the remorseful Jihva. The King's guards swiftly retrieved the royal wealth, exactly as Harisarman had described. Overjoyed and utterly convinced of Harisarman's divine connection, the King heaped upon him precious jewels, rich silks, and a substantial reward, further solidifying his fame.\nYet, the shrewd Minister, Devajnanin, remained unconvinced, his skepticism a persistent shadow. He subtly prompted the King for a final, undeniable test of Harisarman's powers. The King, whose curiosity was piqued, agreed. He had a large, ornate pitcher brought forth, completely sealed and opaque. With a challenging gleam in his eye, the King placed the pitcher before Harisarman and commanded, \"O great sage, tell us, by your divine wisdom, what mysterious creature lies within this vessel?\" Harisarman's blood ran cold; his luck, he feared, had finally deserted him.\nHarisarman, seeing no escape, bowed his head in despair, believing his grand deception was about to unravel. He closed his eyes, a profound sigh escaping his lips, and whispered to himself, \"Ah, Froggie, my poor Froggie, what a sticky situation you've landed yourself in this time!\" This was a childhood nickname, a term of endearment known only to his wife. At that very moment, the King, having discovered a large, green frog playfully leaping by the royal pond earlier that morning, had secretly placed it inside the sealed pitcher as the ultimate, whimsical test of Harisarman's supposed foresight.\nA stunned silence gripped the royal court as Harisarman's words echoed. The King's eyes widened in disbelief, then amusement, then profound admiration. He personally unsealed the pitcher, and lo and behold, a plump green frog hopped out, staring innocently at the gathered assembly. Devajnanin, the skeptical minister, visibly recoiled, his face a mask of utter defeat. From that day forward, Harisarman was not merely honored but revered, appointed to a high position in the court, endowed with unimaginable wealth, and forever known as the sage whose wisdom transcended all earthly bounds, his secret safe beneath his unearned glory.\n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"Sthuladatta\", \"target\": \"Harisarman\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Hierarchy\", \"relationship_level2\": \"master_servant\", \"sentiment\": \"negative\"}]}"}

The sting of their poverty was sharp, but the disrespect, the utter disregard from Sthuladatta and his other wealthy guests, wounded Harisarman's pride far more deeply than any hunger.\nBurning with the humiliation of that night, Harisarman confided in his wife, vowing to shed the shackles of disrespect. A cunning plan began to form in his mind. Under the cloak of the deepest night, he slipped into Sthuladatta’s stables, his heart pounding a rhythm against his ribs. With practiced stealth, Harisarman unlatched the stall of the householder's most magnificent steed, a swift, black mare, leading it away to a secluded thicket far from the village, intending to \"discover\" it later through a fabricated act of divination.\nThe following dawn found Sthuladatta in a frenzy of despair over his missing horse. Harisarman, meanwhile, had subtly allowed whispers of his newfound 'divine sight' to circulate. Approaching the distraught householder, Harisarman feigned a trance, his eyes rolling back as he muttered ancient-sounding incantations. With a dramatic flourish, he declared the horse was not stolen by thieves but had wandered into a specific, distant grove. When Sthuladatta’s men rushed to the spot and miraculously found the mare, Harisarman's reputation as a profound sage spread throughout the land like wildfire.\nNews of Harisarman's miraculous powers soon reached the ears of the King himself. When the royal treasury suffered a daring theft, the King, desperate for a solution, immediately summoned the famed sage. Harisarman, now known far and wide, stood before the majestic monarch, his heart a frantic drum against his ribs. The King commanded him to use his divine sight to locate the stolen wealth. Harisarman felt the chilling trap of his own escalating lies, aware that his previous success was pure fortune, and this time, his fate truly hung by a thread, especially under the cynical gaze of the Minister, Devajnanin.\nThat night, alone in the opulent chambers provided by the King, Harisarman was a wreck of nerves, pacing like a caged tiger. \"Oh, Jihva,\" he groaned, running a hand through his hair, \"My wretched tongue, you have spoken me into this impossible predicament!\" His lament was not unheard. Unbeknownst to him, a palace attendant, a woman named Jihva who served in the King’s household, and who was, in fact, one of the culprits behind the royal theft, happened to be passing by. Overhearing Harisarman’s distraught utterance, Jihva gasped, believing the sage had divined her very name and her crime. Terrified and guilt-ridden, she immediately sought Harisarman and tearfully confessed everything, pleading for mercy.\nArmed with the precise details of Jihva’s confession, Harisarman presented himself before the King the next morning, radiating an aura of serene confidence. He dramatically revealed the exact hiding place of the royal treasure, describing the concealed alcove and the peculiar markings on the chest, all while carefully concealing the identity of the remorseful Jihva. The King's guards swiftly retrieved the royal wealth, exactly as Harisarman had described. Overjoyed and utterly convinced of Harisarman's divine connection, the King heaped upon him precious jewels, rich silks, and a substantial reward, further solidifying his fame.\nYet, the shrewd Minister, Devajnanin, remained unconvinced, his skepticism a persistent shadow. He subtly prompted the King for a final, undeniable test of Harisarman's powers. The King, whose curiosity was piqued, agreed. He had a large, ornate pitcher brought forth, completely sealed and opaque. With a challenging gleam in his eye, the King placed the pitcher before Harisarman and commanded, \"O great sage, tell us, by your divine wisdom, what mysterious creature lies within this vessel?\" Harisarman's blood ran cold; his luck, he feared, had finally deserted him.\nHarisarman, seeing no escape, bowed his head in despair, believing his grand deception was about to unravel. He closed his eyes, a profound sigh escaping his lips, and whispered to himself, \"Ah, Froggie, my poor Froggie, what a sticky situation you've landed yourself in this time!\" This was a childhood nickname, a term of endearment known only to his wife. At that very moment, the King, having discovered a large, green frog playfully leaping by the royal pond earlier that morning, had secretly placed it inside the sealed pitcher as the ultimate, whimsical test of Harisarman's supposed foresight.\nA stunned silence gripped the royal court as Harisarman's words echoed. The King's eyes widened in disbelief, then amusement, then profound admiration. He personally unsealed the pitcher, and lo and behold, a plump green frog hopped out, staring innocently at the gathered assembly. Devajnanin, the skeptical minister, visibly recoiled, his face a mask of utter defeat. From that day forward, Harisarman was not merely honored but revered, appointed to a high position in the court, endowed with unimaginable wealth, and forever known as the sage whose wisdom transcended all earthly bounds, his secret safe beneath his unearned glory.\n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"The King\", \"target\": \"Harisarman\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Hierarchy\", \"relationship_level2\": \"ruler_subject\", \"sentiment\": \"fearful\"}]}"}
