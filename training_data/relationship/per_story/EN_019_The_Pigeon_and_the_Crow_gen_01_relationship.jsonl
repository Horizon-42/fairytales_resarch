From his vantage point, the kitchen below offered a tantalizing spectacle: great brass pots simmering with lentils, mounds of fragrant rice, and, most alluring of all, trays of freshly prepared fish, gleaming with spices. A deep hunger, not just for food but for easy acquisition, stirred within the Greedy Crow, and he began to scheme on how he might gain access to such a perpetual feast.\nThe next morning, Mr. Crow approached The Pigeon, a venerable Bodhisatta known for his boundless compassion and wisdom, who often frequented the merchant’s garden. Adopting a humble demeanor, Mr. Crow bowed low. \"Oh, noble Bodhisatta,\" he cawed, \"Your virtue shines like the morning sun! I am but a lonely bird, and I yearn for the companionship of one so wise. Might I be permitted to share the warmth of your friendship and, perhaps, the gentle shelter you enjoy near the kind merchant's home?\" The Bodhisatta, ever benevolent and seeing only the plea for companionship, readily accepted the Crow’s seemingly sincere request.\nWith The Pigeon’s endorsement, the rich man's cook, a kindly soul named Govind, saw no harm in the new arrival. He had long revered The Pigeon for his gentle nature and the peace he brought to the courtyard. When The Pigeon presented Mr. Crow, Govind, extending the hospitality common in every good Indian home, allowed the Crow to roost on a high, undisturbed beam within the spacious kitchen. From this perch, the Greedy Crow had an even clearer view of the daily abundance, his true intentions still unrecognized beneath his feigned gratitude.\nDays passed, and Mr. Crow continued his pretense of piety. One morning, however, as the Cook prepared to step out for a short errand, laying out a particularly succulent platter of seasoned fish on the counter, Mr. Crow began to squawk pitifully. \"Oh dear friend, my stomach churns with a terrible ailment!\" he cried to The Pigeon, feigning great distress. \"I cannot possibly fly today; I must remain here and rest.\" His voice was full of feigned pain, but his beady eyes darted repeatedly towards the glistening fish, revealing his true motive.\nThe Bodhisatta, watching Mr. Crow’s exaggerated performance and the tell-tale flicker in his eyes towards the food, immediately saw through the deceit. His gentle face saddened. \"Greedy Crow,\" The Pigeon advised softly, \"A dishonest heart brings only suffering. Contentment is the greatest wealth, and greed, a bottomless pit. Do not be tempted by ill-gotten gains, for their taste is always bitter in the end.\" The Crow merely scoffed internally, dismissing the Bodhisatta’s warning, and The Pigeon, understanding that wisdom could not be forced, sighed deeply and flew off to the forest alone.\nAs soon as The Pigeon had departed and the kitchen was quiet, the Greedy Crow’s feigned illness vanished. His eyes gleaming with hunger and malicious triumph, he swooped down from his beam. With a swift movement, he snatched a large piece of the cooked fish in his beak. However, in his eagerness and clumsy haste, his wing brushed against a precarious stack of polished brass utensils, sending them clattering to the stone floor with a resounding crash that echoed through the quiet household.\nThe sudden, sharp noise instantly alerted the rich man's cook, Govind, who was just returning to the kitchen. His eyes fell upon the Guilty Crow, fish in beak, amidst the scattered utensils. Govind’s initial kindness transformed into a furious rage at the betrayal of his hospitality. He seized the offending bird, plucked many of Mr. Crow’s glossy black feathers, then immersed him in a pot of stinging, hot, spiced water, leaving the Crow whimpering and shivering in excruciating pain as punishment for the attempted theft.\nLater, The Pigeon returned to the kitchen, drawn by the lingering scent of distress. He found Mr. Crow a sorry sight, bald and scalded, huddled miserably in a corner basket. \"Ah, Mr. Crow,\" the Bodhisatta cooed, his voice laced with gentle sorrow, \"Is this the sweet reward of your cunning?\" The Crow, utterly broken and humbled by his agony, could only manage a hoarse whisper, \"Indeed, noble friend. My insatiable greed consumed me entirely. I regret my folly.\" With that final, painful confession, Greedy Crow shuddered one last time and succumbed to his wounds, his life a stark lesson in the wages of desire.\n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"The Crow\", \"target\": \"Food\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Neutral\", \"relationship_level2\": \"stranger\", \"sentiment\": \"negative\"}]}"}

From his vantage point, the kitchen below offered a tantalizing spectacle: great brass pots simmering with lentils, mounds of fragrant rice, and, most alluring of all, trays of freshly prepared fish, gleaming with spices. A deep hunger, not just for food but for easy acquisition, stirred within the Greedy Crow, and he began to scheme on how he might gain access to such a perpetual feast.\nThe next morning, Mr. Crow approached The Pigeon, a venerable Bodhisatta known for his boundless compassion and wisdom, who often frequented the merchant’s garden. Adopting a humble demeanor, Mr. Crow bowed low. \"Oh, noble Bodhisatta,\" he cawed, \"Your virtue shines like the morning sun! I am but a lonely bird, and I yearn for the companionship of one so wise. Might I be permitted to share the warmth of your friendship and, perhaps, the gentle shelter you enjoy near the kind merchant's home?\" The Bodhisatta, ever benevolent and seeing only the plea for companionship, readily accepted the Crow’s seemingly sincere request.\nWith The Pigeon’s endorsement, the rich man's cook, a kindly soul named Govind, saw no harm in the new arrival. He had long revered The Pigeon for his gentle nature and the peace he brought to the courtyard. When The Pigeon presented Mr. Crow, Govind, extending the hospitality common in every good Indian home, allowed the Crow to roost on a high, undisturbed beam within the spacious kitchen. From this perch, the Greedy Crow had an even clearer view of the daily abundance, his true intentions still unrecognized beneath his feigned gratitude.\nDays passed, and Mr. Crow continued his pretense of piety. One morning, however, as the Cook prepared to step out for a short errand, laying out a particularly succulent platter of seasoned fish on the counter, Mr. Crow began to squawk pitifully. \"Oh dear friend, my stomach churns with a terrible ailment!\" he cried to The Pigeon, feigning great distress. \"I cannot possibly fly today; I must remain here and rest.\" His voice was full of feigned pain, but his beady eyes darted repeatedly towards the glistening fish, revealing his true motive.\nThe Bodhisatta, watching Mr. Crow’s exaggerated performance and the tell-tale flicker in his eyes towards the food, immediately saw through the deceit. His gentle face saddened. \"Greedy Crow,\" The Pigeon advised softly, \"A dishonest heart brings only suffering. Contentment is the greatest wealth, and greed, a bottomless pit. Do not be tempted by ill-gotten gains, for their taste is always bitter in the end.\" The Crow merely scoffed internally, dismissing the Bodhisatta’s warning, and The Pigeon, understanding that wisdom could not be forced, sighed deeply and flew off to the forest alone.\nAs soon as The Pigeon had departed and the kitchen was quiet, the Greedy Crow’s feigned illness vanished. His eyes gleaming with hunger and malicious triumph, he swooped down from his beam. With a swift movement, he snatched a large piece of the cooked fish in his beak. However, in his eagerness and clumsy haste, his wing brushed against a precarious stack of polished brass utensils, sending them clattering to the stone floor with a resounding crash that echoed through the quiet household.\nThe sudden, sharp noise instantly alerted the rich man's cook, Govind, who was just returning to the kitchen.
