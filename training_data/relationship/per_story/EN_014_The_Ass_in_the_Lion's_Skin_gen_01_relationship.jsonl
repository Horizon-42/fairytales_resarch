Their hearts seizing with terror, they would flee, leaving the imposter lion to graze freely and devour the precious crops throughout the night.\nFor several nights, the villagers awoke to find their fields ravaged, their precious grains trampled and consumed, yet no one dared confront the mythical beast they believed to be a lion. Fear gripped their hearts, but as hunger began to pinch and their livelihoods dwindled, a desperate courage bloomed within them. Under the guidance of their elders, the villagers resolved to drive the predator away. Arming themselves with sturdy bamboo sticks, ancient drums that usually heralded festivals, resonant conch shells, and even pots and pans, they gathered on the edge of the fields, determined to create such a deafening clamor that even a true beast would be compelled to retreat.\nAs the united villagers advanced, their cacophony of shouts, drumbeats, and the piercing wail of conch shells ripped through the pre-dawn stillness. The sudden, overwhelming assault of sound was too much for the poor ass, which was peacefully munching on a patch of sweet tender shoots. Its carefully maintained disguise, its imitation of a fearsome predator, shattered under the weight of pure, unadulterated panic. Forgetting entirely the part it was meant to play, the terrified animal threw its head back and let out a loud, unmistakable bray—a harsh, ragged \"Hee-haw! Hee-haw!\" that echoed across the startled fields.\nAmong the villagers, who stood momentarily stunned by the peculiar cry, was a wise and observant peasant, known for his calm wisdom, who in that very life was the Bodhisatta. He had watched the drama unfold with quiet contemplation. As the ass's bray pierced the air, a knowing smile touched the Wise Man's lips. Stepping forward, he addressed the bewildered crowd, his voice gentle but firm. \"Do not be afraid, good people,\" he announced, his gaze fixed upon the braying creature. \"That is no lion, but merely an ass, its true nature betrayed by its own voice. The king of beasts does not bray!\"\nA wave of understanding, swiftly followed by a surge of furious indignation, swept through the assembled villagers. Their terror dissolved into boiling rage at the ignoble deception. Dropping their drums and conch shells, they rushed towards the trembling animal. With angry shouts, they tore the majestic lion's skin from the quivering ass, revealing its pathetic, gray form. Their frustration and the nights of fear culminated in a brutal reprisal, and with the sticks they had brought to frighten a lion, they began to beat the poor creature relentlessly for its audacity and the Hawker’s cunning trick. The precious lion’s skin, now a symbol of their gullibility, was snatched away.\nThe beating was severe and prolonged, a collective outpouring of the villagers' affronted pride and wasted efforts. When their anger finally subsided and they dispersed, the ass lay still on the dew-kissed grass, its spirit having departed its battered body. The Hawker, who had watched the entire tragic spectacle unfold from a hidden vantage point, crept out from the shadows. He looked at the lifeless form of his beast, then at the distant figures of the villagers carrying away the lion's skin. A profound sigh escaped him. \"Oh, my foolish ass,\" he lamented, shaking his head in sorrow. \"Had you but known to keep silent, that deceitful skin would still be yours, and you would still be alive.

Your own voice, alas, was the instrument of your ruin.\"\n\nSummary:\n\n\nDoers: The Hawker\nReceivers (characters): The Ass\n\n\nFull Story Context:\nIn the verdant plains bordering the village of Nandigram, where the tall grasses swayed like emerald waves, a cunning Hawker hatched a plan to graze his lean ass without paying a single paisa. He had acquired a fearsome lion's skin, complete with mane and claws, and with it, he cloaked his humble beast. Each evening, under the cloak of twilight, the Hawker would lead the disguised ass into the lush, ripe fields belonging to the villagers. The simple watchmen, patrolling the perimeters with their flickering oil lamps, would glimpse the majestic silhouette and hear the rustle of grass, instantly mistaking the creature for a savage king of the jungle. Their hearts seizing with terror, they would flee, leaving the imposter lion to graze freely and devour the precious crops throughout the night.\nFor several nights, the villagers awoke to find their fields ravaged, their precious grains trampled and consumed, yet no one dared confront the mythical beast they believed to be a lion. Fear gripped their hearts, but as hunger began to pinch and their livelihoods dwindled, a desperate courage bloomed within them. Under the guidance of their elders, the villagers resolved to drive the predator away. Arming themselves with sturdy bamboo sticks, ancient drums that usually heralded festivals, resonant conch shells, and even pots and pans, they gathered on the edge of the fields, determined to create such a deafening clamor that even a true beast would be compelled to retreat.\nAs the united villagers advanced, their cacophony of shouts, drumbeats, and the piercing wail of conch shells ripped through the pre-dawn stillness. The sudden, overwhelming assault of sound was too much for the poor ass, which was peacefully munching on a patch of sweet tender shoots. Its carefully maintained disguise, its imitation of a fearsome predator, shattered under the weight of pure, unadulterated panic. Forgetting entirely the part it was meant to play, the terrified animal threw its head back and let out a loud, unmistakable bray—a harsh, ragged \"Hee-haw! Hee-haw!\" that echoed across the startled fields.\nAmong the villagers, who stood momentarily stunned by the peculiar cry, was a wise and observant peasant, known for his calm wisdom, who in that very life was the Bodhisatta. He had watched the drama unfold with quiet contemplation. As the ass's bray pierced the air, a knowing smile touched the Wise Man's lips. Stepping forward, he addressed the bewildered crowd, his voice gentle but firm. \"Do not be afraid, good people,\" he announced, his gaze fixed upon the braying creature. \"That is no lion, but merely an ass, its true nature betrayed by its own voice. The king of beasts does not bray!\"\nA wave of understanding, swiftly followed by a surge of furious indignation, swept through the assembled villagers. Their terror dissolved into boiling rage at the ignoble deception. Dropping their drums and conch shells, they rushed towards the trembling animal. With angry shouts, they tore the majestic lion's skin from the quivering ass, revealing its pathetic, gray form. Their frustration and the nights of fear culminated in a brutal reprisal, and with the sticks they had brought to frighten a lion, they began to beat the poor creature relentlessly for its audacity and the Hawker’s cunning trick. The precious lion’s skin, now a symbol of their gullibility, was snatched away.\nThe beating was severe and prolonged, a collective outpouring of the villagers' affronted pride and wasted efforts. When their anger finally subsided and they dispersed, the ass lay still on the dew-kissed grass, its spirit having departed its battered body. The Hawker, who had watched the entire tragic spectacle unfold from a hidden vantage point, crept out from the shadows. He looked at the lifeless form of his beast, then at the distant figures of the villagers carrying away the lion's skin.
