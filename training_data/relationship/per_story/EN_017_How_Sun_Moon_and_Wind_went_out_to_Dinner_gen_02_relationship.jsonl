The hall shimmered with divine light, tables groaned under the weight of ambrosial sweets, fragrant rice, and countless delicacies prepared with celestial love. Sun, with his radiant hunger, consumed dish after dish, his plate never empty, his focus entirely on his own indulgence. Wind, equally self-absorbed, darted from one delicacy to another, gulping down essences and devouring morsels with no thought beyond his fleeting desires. But Gentle Moon, ever thoughtful of her Mother Star, discreetly wrapped portions of the finest sweets and the most fragrant fruits in a large, cool lotus leaf, carefully preserving them amidst the joyous revelry, ensuring her mother would not be forgotten.\nAs the day gave way to the quiet approach of evening, the three children returned home, their bellies full and their spirits varied. Mother Star, seated upon her cosmic throne, her light a comforting beacon in the gathering twilight, greeted them with a soft, expectant smile. \"My dear children,\" she asked, her voice like the rustling of celestial silks, \"tell me, what did you bring back for your old mother from the magnificent feast of the Devas? Did you remember me amidst all the joy and bounty?\"\nSun, still glowing from his gorging, puffed out his chest and declared, \"Mother, the feast was so grand, so utterly delicious! I ate until my own light could barely contain me, leaving nothing untouched, for every morsel was meant for enjoyment in that very moment.\" Wind, in his turn, circled restlessly, a faint breeze of indifference trailing behind him. \"Indeed, Mother,\" he echoed, \"the food was too exquisite to carry away. It was meant to be savored then and there, fresh and vibrant. I left nothing, taking delight in every single bite myself.\" Both offered no apologies, their admission a stark testament to their lack of consideration.\nThen, from behind her towering brothers, Gentle Moon, with downcast eyes but a heart full of devotion, stepped forward. Her small hands carefully presented the lotus leaf, still cool and fragrant, cradling the saved delicacies. \"Mother,\" she whispered, her voice like the soft chime of temple bells, \"I remembered your gentle wisdom and love. Though the feast was boundless, I tucked away these few humble offerings for you, for a mother's hunger is often overlooked in the mirth of her children.\" A faint aroma of sweet rice and mangoes wafted from the leaf.\nMother Star gazed upon her two selfish sons, her eyes, usually a kaleidoscope of gentle cosmic light, narrowing into points of burning disappointment. Her voice deepened, resonating through the celestial spheres with the power of cosmic law. \"Sun, my Eldest, because you consumed all and forgot your mother, your heat shall forever be a torment. You shall burn with such intensity that all who approach you shall shrink away in discomfort and pain. Your light, though vital, will be a merciless force, scorching the earth and making life difficult for those under your direct gaze, a constant reminder of your burning selfishness.\" And from that moment, Sun's heat became unbearable.\nTurning her gaze, imbued with cosmic decree, upon Wind, Mother Star continued, \"And you, Wind, who blew through the feast with no thought for another, you shall forever bear the burden of your inconsideration. When your brother Sun is at his most intense, you too shall be hot and dry, sweeping through the lands, bringing parched sorrow and discomfort. Your touch shall be unwelcome, wilting the life you could otherwise nourish, forever tied to the harshness that reflects your own greedy spirit.\" And so it was, that the Wind, during the hot seasons, became a harsh, dry gust.\nFinally, Mother Star turned her gaze, now overflowing with love and pride, upon Gentle Moon, her beloved Daughter. Her voice softened, becoming as melodious as a celestial lullaby. \"But you, my Gentle Moon, who remembered your mother with such sweet devotion, you shall be blessed with a light that is ever cool, calm, and universally beloved. Your presence will bring peace and solace to the weary world. You shall soothe the heat that your brother Sun inflicts, and your serene beauty shall be cherished by all who gaze upon you, a beacon of selfless love and tenderness, forever shining with a gentle, comforting radiance.\" Thus, Gentle Moon became the serene solace of the night.\n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"Star\", \"target\": \"Sun\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Family & Kinship\", \"relationship_level2\": \"parent_child\", \"sentiment\": \"neutral\"}]}"}
