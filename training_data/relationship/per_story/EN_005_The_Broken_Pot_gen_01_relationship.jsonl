His mind, unburdened by sleep, began to weave an intricate tapestry of prosperity. \"This rice,\" he mused to himself, \"I shall sell it for a small profit. With that profit, I shall buy more rice, much more, and trade it in the bustling market for even greater gains. Soon, I will have enough silver to purchase a flock of goats, then a herd of cows, whose milk and offspring will fetch me a fortune in gold. Lands I shall acquire, vast fields yielding bountiful harvests, and stately mansions shall rise under my name. Oh, what a wealthy man I, Svabhavakripana, shall become!\"\n\nSummary:\nSvabhavakripana, a miserly man, hoards a small pot of rice, envisioning a future of wealth through calculated trades and acquisitions. His fantasies of prosperity and family life spiral into obsession, leading him to accidentally shatter the pot with a kick, destroying his meager resources.
