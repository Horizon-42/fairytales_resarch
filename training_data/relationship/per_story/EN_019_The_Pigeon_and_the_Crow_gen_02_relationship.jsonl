Aromatic clouds of spice and simmering delights drifted upwards, teasing his senses. Through the open window, he glimpsed platters piled high with freshly fried fish, golden sweetmeats, and fragrant curries cooling on the sills. His dark eyes glinted with a nefarious desire; his heart, a tiny, black knot of gluttony, began to scheme a way to gain access to such a feast, far beyond the meager scraps he usually scavenged.\n\nSummary:\nThe story follows The Crow, a greedy bird who deceives the wise and compassionate Pigeon into gaining access to a wealthy merchant's kitchen.
