His harvests were meager, his family often hungry, while the Money-lender, Sethji, grew fatter and richer each year, his mansion looming over the humble huts. One day, desperation gnawing at his heart, Govind approached Sethji, his voice meek yet earnest. \"Oh, revered Sethji,\" he pleaded, bowing low, \"you possess such immense wealth and fortune. Would you, in your boundless generosity, reveal to me the secret to becoming prosperous?\"\nSethji, a corpulent man with a perpetual sneer, chuckled unkindly at Govind's naive request. \"Wealth?\" he scoffed, waving a dismissive hand. \"It is not a secret, simpleton, but a divine blessing! Only God, Ram himself, can grant such a boon. Go, find Ram, and beg him for it.\" Taking the Money-lender's sarcastic advice as a genuine truth, Govind, a man of simple faith, felt a flicker of hope. He gathered his meager possessions—a worn dhoti, a small clay pot for water, and a few handfuls of dried millet—and, bidding his tearful family farewell, embarked on a solitary journey towards the distant mountains, believing he could truly find the Lord Ram there.\nDays bled into weeks as Govind trekked through sun-baked plains and across stony riverbeds, his provisions dwindling to almost nothing, his body aching with fatigue. One sweltering afternoon, beneath the sprawling shade of an ancient banyan tree, he stumbled upon an old, emaciated man, his face etched with hunger and hardship, his clothes ragged. Though Govind himself was famished, down to his very last handful of precious millet, his compassionate heart overtook his hunger. He knelt before the seemingly poor man and, without a moment's hesitation, offered his final meal, saying, \"Venerable one, you appear to be in greater need than I. Please, accept this offering.\"\nAs the old man gratefully consumed the millet, a blinding, ethereal light erupted around him, his frail form transforming into the majestic and benevolent Lord Ram, adorned with a radiant crown and holding his divine conch, discus, mace, and lotus. Govind fell prostrate, overcome with awe and reverence. Ram, his voice resonating like a celestial melody, smiled warmly. \"O pious farmer,\" he declared, \"your selfless compassion has moved me deeply. As a reward for your pure heart, take this divine Shankha, this magical conch. Blow it, and whatever you wish for will be granted. Use it with wisdom and discretion, for great power carries great responsibility.\" With a final, gentle blessing, Lord Ram ascended back into the heavens, leaving the shimmering conch in Govind's trembling hands.\nGovind returned to his village, and soon, through the judicious wishes made with the sacred conch, his barren land became fertile, yielding abundant crops, and his humble hut transformed into a comfortable home. Sethji, the Money-lender, observing Govind’s sudden prosperity, grew consumed by envy and suspicion. He visited Govind, feigning friendliness, asking how such a transformation had occurred. With honeyed words and cunning questions, he slowly coaxed the guileless farmer into revealing the secret of the magical conch. That very night, under the cloak of darkness, Sethji stealthily crept into Govind’s home and, finding the farmer asleep, snatched the glistening Shankha from his bedside.\nSethji, now in possession of the powerful conch, eagerly tried to invoke its magic, but no matter how hard he blew, the Shankha remained silent and cold in his grasping hands; its divine power only responded to the purity of Govind’s heart. Frustrated but ever cunning, Sethji confronted Govind the next morning, holding the conch aloft. \"Foolish farmer!\" he sneered, \"This trinket responds only to you, but it is *I* who holds it! We shall make a new arrangement. From now on, whatever you wish for using this conch, I shall receive double.\" Govind, understanding the Money-lender's wicked greed and finding himself trapped, felt a cold knot of dread mixed with a steely resolve form in his chest.\nCornered by the Money-lender’s cruel decree, Govind carefully considered his options, a daring plan slowly taking shape in his mind. With a heavy sigh that masked his cunning intent, he agreed to Sethji's terms. He knelt before the conch, which Sethji still held firmly, and, with a deep breath, focused his mind on his extraordinary wish. His voice, though slightly trembling, was clear as he declared, \"Oh, divine Shankha, I wish to lose one of my eyes.\" A blinding flash erupted from the conch, and Govind instantly felt a searing pain as his left eye went dark, but a subtle, knowing smile touched his lips.\nSethji, clutching his face, screamed in excruciating agony as the blinding light from the conch struck him, causing both of his eyes to instantly burn out, just as Govind had intended. Completely sightless and consumed by unimaginable pain and terror, Sethji stumbled wildly backward in his opulent but now darkened mansion. He tripped over a discarded velvet cushion, lost his footing on the polished marble steps, and tumbled headfirst, striking his head against the hard floor below with a sickening thud.

Only God, Ram himself, can grant such a boon. Go, find Ram, and beg him for it.\" Taking the Money-lender's sarcastic advice as a genuine truth, Govind, a man of simple faith, felt a flicker of hope. He gathered his meager possessions—a worn dhoti, a small clay pot for water, and a few handfuls of dried millet—and, bidding his tearful family farewell, embarked on a solitary journey towards the distant mountains, believing he could truly find the Lord Ram there.\nDays bled into weeks as Govind trekked through sun-baked plains and across stony riverbeds, his provisions dwindling to almost nothing, his body aching with fatigue. One sweltering afternoon, beneath the sprawling shade of an ancient banyan tree, he stumbled upon an old, emaciated man, his face etched with hunger and hardship, his clothes ragged. Though Govind himself was famished, down to his very last handful of precious millet, his compassionate heart overtook his hunger. He knelt before the seemingly poor man and, without a moment's hesitation, offered his final meal, saying, \"Venerable one, you appear to be in greater need than I. Please, accept this offering.\"\nAs the old man gratefully consumed the millet, a blinding, ethereal light erupted around him, his frail form transforming into the majestic and benevolent Lord Ram, adorned with a radiant crown and holding his divine conch, discus, mace, and lotus. Govind fell prostrate, overcome with awe and reverence. Ram, his voice resonating like a celestial melody, smiled warmly. \"O pious farmer,\" he declared, \"your selfless compassion has moved me deeply. As a reward for your pure heart, take this divine Shankha, this magical conch. Blow it, and whatever you wish for will be granted. Use it with wisdom and discretion, for great power carries great responsibility.\" With a final, gentle blessing, Lord Ram ascended back into the heavens, leaving the shimmering conch in Govind's trembling hands.\nGovind returned to his village, and soon, through the judicious wishes made with the sacred conch, his barren land became fertile, yielding abundant crops, and his humble hut transformed into a comfortable home. Sethji, the Money-lender, observing Govind’s sudden prosperity, grew consumed by envy and suspicion. He visited Govind, feigning friendliness, asking how such a transformation had occurred. With honeyed words and cunning questions, he slowly coaxed the guileless farmer into revealing the secret of the magical conch. That very night, under the cloak of darkness, Sethji stealthily crept into Govind’s home and, finding the farmer asleep, snatched the glistening Shankha from his bedside.\nSethji, now in possession of the powerful conch, eagerly tried to invoke its magic, but no matter how hard he blew, the Shankha remained silent and cold in his grasping hands; its divine power only responded to the purity of Govind’s heart. Frustrated but ever cunning, Sethji confronted Govind the next morning, holding the conch aloft. \"Foolish farmer!\" he sneered, \"This trinket responds only to you, but it is *I* who holds it! We shall make a new arrangement. From now on, whatever you wish for using this conch, I shall receive double.\" Govind, understanding the Money-lender's wicked greed and finding himself trapped, felt a cold knot of dread mixed with a steely resolve form in his chest.\nCornered by the Money-lender’s cruel decree, Govind carefully considered his options, a daring plan slowly taking shape in his mind. With a heavy sigh that masked his cunning intent, he agreed to Sethji's terms. He knelt before the conch, which Sethji still held firmly, and, with a deep breath, focused his mind on his extraordinary wish. His voice, though slightly trembling, was clear as he declared, \"Oh, divine Shankha, I wish to lose one of my eyes.\" A blinding flash erupted from the conch, and Govind instantly felt a searing pain as his left eye went dark, but a subtle, knowing smile touched his lips.\nSethji, clutching his face, screamed in excruciating agony as the blinding light from the conch struck him, causing both of his eyes to instantly burn out, just as Govind had intended. Completely sightless and consumed by unimaginable pain and terror, Sethji stumbled wildly backward in his opulent but now darkened mansion. He tripped over a discarded velvet cushion, lost his footing on the polished marble steps, and tumbled headfirst, striking his head against the hard floor below with a sickening thud. The Money-lender, the embodiment of greed, died instantly, a direct casualty of his own avarice and the farmer's clever, desperate wish.\n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"The Money-lender\", \"target\": \"The Farmer\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Adversarial\", \"relationship_level2\": \"enemy\", \"sentiment\": \"negative\"}]}"}
