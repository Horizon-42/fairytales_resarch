Their leader, a corpulent man with a scarred face, leered at the shivering merchants. \"Ha! What a pitiful sight!\" he bellowed. \"But even plucked pigeons can dance, can they not? Amuse us, you wretched traders! Dance for your masters!\" And so, with taunts and prods, the robbers forced the humiliated merchants to perform a grotesque dance, their bare feet shuffling awkwardly in the dust, their hearts heavy with despair and the sting of injustice.\nAs the merchants reluctantly capered, their Clever Merchant, the Leader, observed his captors closely. He noticed their arrogance, their distraction, and the slight weariness in their posture from their drunken revelry. A cunning plan sparked in his mind. With a deep breath, he began to sing, his voice carrying a melancholic tune that seemed to lament their plight, yet within its rhythm, he wove words understood only by his fellow Traders. \"Erith, enty, eno, the wind it blows so low,\" he crooned, his eyes subtly flicking towards the nearest robber. \"Erith, enty, eno, a grip upon the foe!

Like a sudden gust of wind, they moved as one, their naked bodies surprisingly agile. One merchant tripped a robber with his foot, another seized a discarded club, and a third, with a surge of strength, tackled a villain, causing him to drop his dagger. In a whirlwind of swift, desperate movements, they overpowered the surprised robbers, using their own stolen dhotis and lengths of fine silk from their plundered bales to bind the struggling bandits securely, their pride now thoroughly humbled.\nWith the Three Robbers trussed like sacks of grain, their boasting silenced and their power shattered, the merchants quickly recovered their stolen clothing and their precious goods. The Clever Merchant, still composed, oversaw the gathering of every coin, every bolt of silk, and every turban. The journey home, which had begun in despair, now transformed into a triumphant procession.
