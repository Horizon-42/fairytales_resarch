His royal council meetings often stretched for hours, not due to complex state matters, but because the King would digress into endless anecdotes, opinions, and pronouncements, often repeating himself. This garrulousness often left his ministers, including his wise adviser, the Bodisat—who was the Future Buddha—weary and unable to present urgent matters effectively.
