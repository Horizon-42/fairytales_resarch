Daily she would warn him, \"My son, hunt in the north, the south, the east, but never, ever venture to the fourth side, for there lies a secret best left undisturbed, a path to desires that can lead only to peril.\" Yet, her words, though born of love, only piqued the Prince’s youthful curiosity, planting the seed of the forbidden.\nOne sun-drenched morning, unable to resist the lure of the unknown, the Raja's Son defied his mother's solemn interdiction. He rode his swift steed to the forbidden fourth side, where the forest grew thick and mysterious. Deep within its silent depths, he discovered a magnificent Hiraman Parrot, perched on a branch, its feathers shimmering like jewels, speaking in a voice as clear and melodious as a temple bell.\nThe Raja of Parrots, observing the Prince's regal bearing, began to speak of wonders, painting vivid word-pictures of Princess Labam, whose beauty surpassed the moon, whose grace shamed the lotus, and whose wisdom outshone the brightest stars. The parrot's tales ignited an unquenchable fire in the Young Prince’s heart, a fervent desire to see, to meet, and to win this peerless Princess Labam.\nUpon his return, the Prince, filled with a newfound purpose, humbly yet resolutely sought permission from his parents to embark on a quest to find Princess Labam. Though reluctant and heavy-hearted at the thought of their son’s perilous journey, they eventually yielded to his unwavering resolve, equipping him with a sturdy horse, ample provisions, and a pouch of gold coins for his arduous travels.\nAs the Young Prince journeyed through a vast desert, he encountered a colossal army of ants struggling to carry a single grain of rice, their harvest scattered by a cruel wind. Instead of simply stepping over them, he dismounted, gathered the grains, and carefully placed them back in their path. The grateful Ant-Raja, witnessing this act of profound kindness, emerged and promised, \"Noble Prince, for your compassion, I shall repay your goodness when you are in dire need.\"\nLater, traversing a dense jungle, the Raja's Son stumbled upon a fearsome Tiger, roaring in pain, a sharp thorn deeply embedded in its massive paw. Undeterred by fear, the Prince, with gentle hands and a brave heart, knelt and carefully extracted the painful splinter. The Tiger, its eyes softening, licked the Prince's hand in gratitude and vowed, \"My Prince, should peril ever strike, call upon me, and I shall come to your aid, swift and fierce.\"\nOne evening, seeking rest by a banyan tree, the Prince observed four powerful Fakirs squabbling fiercely over their magical possessions: a flying bed, a never-empty alms bag, a truth-telling bowl, and a self-tying rope. Cunningly, the Raja's Son intervened, suggesting a competition to determine who was strongest. While they exerted themselves, he swiftly and silently gathered all four magical objects, mounting the enchanted bed and flying away, leaving the duped Fakirs bewildered and empty-handed.\nFinally, guided by the Fakirs' magic bowl, the Prince arrived at the outskirts of the magnificent city where Princess Labam resided. Disguising his princely attire, he sought shelter, approaching an old woman’s humble dwelling. With a warm smile and a convincing tale, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, an orphan seeking kin, and the kind-hearted old woman, known as Aunty in the neighborhood, welcomed him into her modest home, unaware of his true identity.\nUnder the cloak of darkness, the Raja's Son invoked the magic of his flying bed, ascending to the palace walls and silently entering Princess Labam's chamber. He found her asleep, her beauty even more radiant than the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a moment, then, as a subtle token of his presence, he left a single, perfectly folded betel-leaf on her bedside table before vanishing into the night.\nIntrigued by the mysterious betel-leaf, Princess Labam spoke of it to no one, but pondered its meaning. A few nights later, the Young Prince, drawn by an irresistible pull, once again used his magic bed to visit her chamber. This time, as she lay in slumber, he gently placed a richly embroidered silk shawl over her, a tangible whisper of his admiration, and again, he departed unseen, leaving her to awaken to another enigmatic gift.\nThe Princess, now certain of a secret admirer, feigned sleep on the Prince's third visit. As he softly approached, she opened her luminous eyes. Startled but emboldened, the Raja's Son finally revealed his identity, his royal lineage, and the depth of his devotion. Gazing into his earnest eyes, Princess Labam, who had already felt an inexplicable connection to her mysterious visitor, accepted his proposal, agreeing to marry him.\nWhen Princess Labam's father, The King, learned of his daughter's secret betrothal to an unknown prince, his royal wrath flared. To test the Young Prince's worth, or rather, to deter him, The King assigned an impossible task: to crush enough oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds to fill the royal reservoir, all within a single day, an endeavor that would usually take months.\nThe Raja's Son, faced with this overwhelming challenge, despaired, but then remembered his promise-bound friend. He quietly summoned the Ant-Raja, who, true to his word, arrived with his entire industrious army. By dawn, the countless ants had meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting the oil and filling the reservoir, leaving The King utterly astonished.\nStill unwilling to accept defeat, The King, in his relentless pursuit to rid himself of the audacious Prince, issued another daunting command. He ordered the Raja's Son to venture into the cursed southern jungles and slay two ferocious demons who had long terrorized his kingdom, believing this task would surely lead to the Prince's demise.\nOnce more, the Young Prince called upon his sworn ally. With a thunderous roar, the mighty Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. Without hesitation, the Tiger charged into the jungle, swiftly engaging the monstrous demons in a brutal, decisive battle. By morning, the Tiger returned, its paws stained, having vanquished both creatures, leaving The King gaping in disbelief at the Prince’s uncanny success.\nHis schemes repeatedly foiled, The King devised a public spectacle for the Prince's next impossible task. He commanded the Raja's Son to beat the great kettle_drum that hung suspended impossibly high in the heavens, a drum that traditionally heralded royal victories, confident that no mortal man could ever reach it.\nThe Raja's Son, undaunted, retrieved the magic bed he had acquired from the Fakirs. Before the astonished eyes of the entire court and kingdom, he mounted the enchanted bed, which ascended majestically into the clear blue sky. With a flourish, he reached the colossal kettle_drum and struck it with a resounding beat, its boom echoing across the land, proving his triumph.\nIn a final, desperate attempt to thwart the marriage, The King presented the Young Prince with a riddle disguised as a task: he must cut down the ancient, unyielding Royal Banyan Tree at the palace gates using only a fragile hatchet made of wax, a task designed to be logically impossible.\nFor the first time, the Prince found himself truly stumped. But Princess Labam, watching from her balcony, had anticipated her father's cunning. She swiftly retrieved a single, shimmering hair from her own head, a strand imbued with ancient magic, and discreetly passed it to the Raja's Son. When he touched the wax hatchet with the magic hair, it transformed, gaining the power to effortlessly slice through the enormous tree.\nWith all trials overcome, The King, left with no alternative but to acknowledge the Prince's valor and destiny, finally gave his blessings. A magnificent wedding ceremony was held, uniting the Raja's Son and Princess Labam in joyous matrimony. The hero, with his beautiful bride by his side, returned to his homeland, where they were welcomed with grand celebrations and ruled their kingdom with wisdom and love, living happily ever after.\n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"Rani\", \"target\": \"Raja's Son\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Family & Kinship\", \"relationship_level2\": \"parent_child\", \"sentiment\": \"negative\"}]}"}

The Tiger, its eyes softening, licked the Prince's hand in gratitude and vowed, \"My Prince, should peril ever strike, call upon me, and I shall come to your aid, swift and fierce.\"\nOne evening, seeking rest by a banyan tree, the Prince observed four powerful Fakirs squabbling fiercely over their magical possessions: a flying bed, a never-empty alms bag, a truth-telling bowl, and a self-tying rope. Cunningly, the Raja's Son intervened, suggesting a competition to determine who was strongest. While they exerted themselves, he swiftly and silently gathered all four magical objects, mounting the enchanted bed and flying away, leaving the duped Fakirs bewildered and empty-handed.\nFinally, guided by the Fakirs' magic bowl, the Prince arrived at the outskirts of the magnificent city where Princess Labam resided. Disguising his princely attire, he sought shelter, approaching an old woman’s humble dwelling. With a warm smile and a convincing tale, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, an orphan seeking kin, and the kind-hearted old woman, known as Aunty in the neighborhood, welcomed him into her modest home, unaware of his true identity.\nUnder the cloak of darkness, the Raja's Son invoked the magic of his flying bed, ascending to the palace walls and silently entering Princess Labam's chamber. He found her asleep, her beauty even more radiant than the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a moment, then, as a subtle token of his presence, he left a single, perfectly folded betel-leaf on her bedside table before vanishing into the night.\nIntrigued by the mysterious betel-leaf, Princess Labam spoke of it to no one, but pondered its meaning. A few nights later, the Young Prince, drawn by an irresistible pull, once again used his magic bed to visit her chamber. This time, as she lay in slumber, he gently placed a richly embroidered silk shawl over her, a tangible whisper of his admiration, and again, he departed unseen, leaving her to awaken to another enigmatic gift.\nThe Princess, now certain of a secret admirer, feigned sleep on the Prince's third visit. As he softly approached, she opened her luminous eyes. Startled but emboldened, the Raja's Son finally revealed his identity, his royal lineage, and the depth of his devotion. Gazing into his earnest eyes, Princess Labam, who had already felt an inexplicable connection to her mysterious visitor, accepted his proposal, agreeing to marry him.\nWhen Princess Labam's father, The King, learned of his daughter's secret betrothal to an unknown prince, his royal wrath flared. To test the Young Prince's worth, or rather, to deter him, The King assigned an impossible task: to crush enough oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds to fill the royal reservoir, all within a single day, an endeavor that would usually take months.\nThe Raja's Son, faced with this overwhelming challenge, despaired, but then remembered his promise-bound friend. He quietly summoned the Ant-Raja, who, true to his word, arrived with his entire industrious army. By dawn, the countless ants had meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting the oil and filling the reservoir, leaving The King utterly astonished.\nStill unwilling to accept defeat, The King, in his relentless pursuit to rid himself of the audacious Prince, issued another daunting command. He ordered the Raja's Son to venture into the cursed southern jungles and slay two ferocious demons who had long terrorized his kingdom, believing this task would surely lead to the Prince's demise.\nOnce more, the Young Prince called upon his sworn ally. With a thunderous roar, the mighty Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. Without hesitation, the Tiger charged into the jungle, swiftly engaging the monstrous demons in a brutal, decisive battle. By morning, the Tiger returned, its paws stained, having vanquished both creatures, leaving The King gaping in disbelief at the Prince’s uncanny success.\nHis schemes repeatedly foiled, The King devised a public spectacle for the Prince's next impossible task. He commanded the Raja's Son to beat the great kettle_drum that hung suspended impossibly high in the heavens, a drum that traditionally heralded royal victories, confident that no mortal man could ever reach it.\nThe Raja's Son, undaunted, retrieved the magic bed he had acquired from the Fakirs. Before the astonished eyes of the entire court and kingdom, he mounted the enchanted bed, which ascended majestically into the clear blue sky. With a flourish, he reached the colossal kettle_drum and struck it with a resounding beat, its boom echoing across the land, proving his triumph.\nIn a final, desperate attempt to thwart the marriage, The King presented the Young Prince with a riddle disguised as a task: he must cut down the ancient, unyielding Royal Banyan Tree at the palace gates using only a fragile hatchet made of wax, a task designed to be logically impossible.\nFor the first time, the Prince found himself truly stumped. But Princess Labam, watching from her balcony, had anticipated her father's cunning. She swiftly retrieved a single, shimmering hair from her own head, a strand imbued with ancient magic, and discreetly passed it to the Raja's Son. When he touched the wax hatchet with the magic hair, it transformed, gaining the power to effortlessly slice through the enormous tree.\nWith all trials overcome, The King, left with no alternative but to acknowledge the Prince's valor and destiny, finally gave his blessings. A magnificent wedding ceremony was held, uniting the Raja's Son and Princess Labam in joyous matrimony. The hero, with his beautiful bride by his side, returned to his homeland, where they were welcomed with grand celebrations and ruled their kingdom with wisdom and love, living happily ever after.\n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"Raja's Son\", \"target\": \"\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Family & Kinship\", \"relationship_level2\": \"parent_child\", \"sentiment\": \"positive\"}]}"}

To test the Young Prince's worth, or rather, to deter him, The King assigned an impossible task: to crush enough oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds to fill the royal reservoir, all within a single day, an endeavor that would usually take months.\nThe Raja's Son, faced with this overwhelming challenge, despaired, but then remembered his promise-bound friend. He quietly summoned the Ant-Raja, who, true to his word, arrived with his entire industrious army. By dawn, the countless ants had meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting the oil and filling the reservoir, leaving The King utterly astonished.\nStill unwilling to accept defeat, The King, in his relentless pursuit to rid himself of the audacious Prince, issued another daunting command. He ordered the Raja's Son to venture into the cursed southern jungles and slay two ferocious demons who had long terrorized his kingdom, believing this task would surely lead to the Prince's demise.\nOnce more, the Young Prince called upon his sworn ally. With a thunderous roar, the mighty Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. Without hesitation, the Tiger charged into the jungle, swiftly engaging the monstrous demons in a brutal, decisive battle. By morning, the Tiger returned, its paws stained, having vanquished both creatures, leaving The King gaping in disbelief at the Prince’s uncanny success.\nHis schemes repeatedly foiled, The King devised a public spectacle for the Prince's next impossible task. He commanded the Raja's Son to beat the great kettle_drum that hung suspended impossibly high in the heavens, a drum that traditionally heralded royal victories, confident that no mortal man could ever reach it.\nThe Raja's Son, undaunted, retrieved the magic bed he had acquired from the Fakirs. Before the astonished eyes of the entire court and kingdom, he mounted the enchanted bed, which ascended majestically into the clear blue sky. With a flourish, he reached the colossal kettle_drum and struck it with a resounding beat, its boom echoing across the land, proving his triumph.\nIn a final, desperate attempt to thwart the marriage, The King presented the Young Prince with a riddle disguised as a task: he must cut down the ancient, unyielding Royal Banyan Tree at the palace gates using only a fragile hatchet made of wax, a task designed to be logically impossible.\nFor the first time, the Prince found himself truly stumped. But Princess Labam, watching from her balcony, had anticipated her father's cunning. She swiftly retrieved a single, shimmering hair from her own head, a strand imbued with ancient magic, and discreetly passed it to the Raja's Son. When he touched the wax hatchet with the magic hair, it transformed, gaining the power to effortlessly slice through the enormous tree.\nWith all trials overcome, The King, left with no alternative but to acknowledge the Prince's valor and destiny, finally gave his blessings. A magnificent wedding ceremony was held, uniting the Raja's Son and Princess Labam in joyous matrimony. The hero, with his beautiful bride by his side, returned to his homeland, where they were welcomed with grand celebrations and ruled their kingdom with wisdom and love, living happily ever after.\n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"Raja's Son\", \"target\": \"Old Woman\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Social & Alliance\", \"relationship_level2\": \"colleague\", \"sentiment\": \"positive\"}]}"}

Daily she would warn him, \"My son, hunt in the north, the south, the east, but never, ever venture to the fourth side, for there lies a secret best left undisturbed, a path to desires that can lead only to peril.\" Yet, her words, though born of love, only piqued the Prince’s youthful curiosity, planting the seed of the forbidden.\nOne sun-drenched morning, unable to resist the lure of the unknown, the Raja's Son defied his mother's solemn interdiction. He rode his swift steed to the forbidden fourth side, where the forest grew thick and mysterious. Deep within its silent depths, he discovered a magnificent Hiraman Parrot, perched on a branch, its feathers shimmering like jewels, speaking in a voice as clear and melodious as a temple bell.\nThe Raja of Parrots, observing the Prince's regal bearing, began to speak of wonders, painting vivid word-pictures of Princess Labam, whose beauty surpassed the moon, whose grace shamed the lotus, and whose wisdom outshone the brightest stars. The parrot's tales ignited an unquenchable fire in the Young Prince’s heart, a fervent desire to see, to meet, and to win this peerless Princess Labam.\nUpon his return, the Prince, filled with a newfound purpose, humbly yet resolutely sought permission from his parents to embark on a quest to find Princess Labam. Though reluctant and heavy-hearted at the thought of their son’s perilous journey, they eventually yielded to his unwavering resolve, equipping him with a sturdy horse, ample provisions, and a pouch of gold coins for his arduous travels.\nAs the Young Prince journeyed through a vast desert, he encountered a colossal army of ants struggling to carry a single grain of rice, their harvest scattered by a cruel wind. Instead of simply stepping over them, he dismounted, gathered the grains, and carefully placed them back in their path. The grateful Ant-Raja, witnessing this act of profound kindness, emerged and promised, \"Noble Prince, for your compassion, I shall repay your goodness when you are in dire need.\"\nLater, traversing a dense jungle, the Raja's Son stumbled upon a fearsome Tiger, roaring in pain, a sharp thorn deeply embedded in its massive paw. Undeterred by fear, the Prince, with gentle hands and a brave heart, knelt and carefully extracted the painful splinter. The Tiger, its eyes softening, licked the Prince's hand in gratitude and vowed, \"My Prince, should peril ever strike, call upon me, and I shall come to your aid, swift and fierce.\"\nOne evening, seeking rest by a banyan tree, the Prince observed four powerful Fakirs squabbling fiercely over their magical possessions: a flying bed, a never-empty alms bag, a truth-telling bowl, and a self-tying rope. Cunningly, the Raja's Son intervened, suggesting a competition to determine who was strongest. While they exerted themselves, he swiftly and silently gathered all four magical objects, mounting the enchanted bed and flying away, leaving the duped Fakirs bewildered and empty-handed.\nFinally, guided by the Fakirs' magic bowl, the Prince arrived at the outskirts of the magnificent city where Princess Labam resided. Disguising his princely attire, he sought shelter, approaching an old woman’s humble dwelling. With a warm smile and a convincing tale, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, an orphan seeking kin, and the kind-hearted old woman, known as Aunty in the neighborhood, welcomed him into her modest home, unaware of his true identity.\nUnder the cloak of darkness, the Raja's Son invoked the magic of his flying bed, ascending to the palace walls and silently entering Princess Labam's chamber. He found her asleep, her beauty even more radiant than the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a moment, then, as a subtle token of his presence, he left a single, perfectly folded betel-leaf on her bedside table before vanishing into the night.\nIntrigued by the mysterious betel-leaf, Princess Labam spoke of it to no one, but pondered its meaning. A few nights later, the Young Prince, drawn by an irresistible pull, once again used his magic bed to visit her chamber. This time, as she lay in slumber, he gently placed a richly embroidered silk shawl over her, a tangible whisper of his admiration, and again, he departed unseen, leaving her to awaken to another enigmatic gift.\nThe Princess, now certain of a secret admirer, feigned sleep on the Prince's third visit. As he softly approached, she opened her luminous eyes. Startled but emboldened, the Raja's Son finally revealed his identity, his royal lineage, and the depth of his devotion.

Daily she would warn him, \"My son, hunt in the north, the south, the east, but never, ever venture to the fourth side, for there lies a secret best left undisturbed, a path to desires that can lead only to peril.\" Yet, her words, though born of love, only piqued the Prince’s youthful curiosity, planting the seed of the forbidden.\nOne sun-drenched morning, unable to resist the lure of the unknown, the Raja's Son defied his mother's solemn interdiction. He rode his swift steed to the forbidden fourth side, where the forest grew thick and mysterious. Deep within its silent depths, he discovered a magnificent Hiraman Parrot, perched on a branch, its feathers shimmering like jewels, speaking in a voice as clear and melodious as a temple bell.\nThe Raja of Parrots, observing the Prince's regal bearing, began to speak of wonders, painting vivid word-pictures of Princess Labam, whose beauty surpassed the moon, whose grace shamed the lotus, and whose wisdom outshone the brightest stars. The parrot's tales ignited an unquenchable fire in the Young Prince’s heart, a fervent desire to see, to meet, and to win this peerless Princess Labam.\nUpon his return, the Prince, filled with a newfound purpose, humbly yet resolutely sought permission from his parents to embark on a quest to find Princess Labam. Though reluctant and heavy-hearted at the thought of their son’s perilous journey, they eventually yielded to his unwavering resolve, equipping him with a sturdy horse, ample provisions, and a pouch of gold coins for his arduous travels.\nAs the Young Prince journeyed through a vast desert, he encountered a colossal army of ants struggling to carry a single grain of rice, their harvest scattered by a cruel wind. Instead of simply stepping over them, he dismounted, gathered the grains, and carefully placed them back in their path. The grateful Ant-Raja, witnessing this act of profound kindness, emerged and promised, \"Noble Prince, for your compassion, I shall repay your goodness when you are in dire need.\"\nLater, traversing a dense jungle, the Raja's Son stumbled upon a fearsome Tiger, roaring in pain, a sharp thorn deeply embedded in its massive paw. Undeterred by fear, the Prince, with gentle hands and a brave heart, knelt and carefully extracted the painful splinter. The Tiger, its eyes softening, licked the Prince's hand in gratitude and vowed, \"My Prince, should peril ever strike, call upon me, and I shall come to your aid, swift and fierce.\"\nOne evening, seeking rest by a banyan tree, the Prince observed four powerful Fakirs squabbling fiercely over their magical possessions: a flying bed, a never-empty alms bag, a truth-telling bowl, and a self-tying rope. Cunningly, the Raja's Son intervened, suggesting a competition to determine who was strongest. While they exerted themselves, he swiftly and silently gathered all four magical objects, mounting the enchanted bed and flying away, leaving the duped Fakirs bewildered and empty-handed.\nFinally, guided by the Fakirs' magic bowl, the Prince arrived at the outskirts of the magnificent city where Princess Labam resided. Disguising his princely attire, he sought shelter, approaching an old woman’s humble dwelling. With a warm smile and a convincing tale, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, an orphan seeking kin, and the kind-hearted old woman, known as Aunty in the neighborhood, welcomed him into her modest home, unaware of his true identity.\nUnder the cloak of darkness, the Raja's Son invoked the magic of his flying bed, ascending to the palace walls and silently entering Princess Labam's chamber. He found her asleep, her beauty even more radiant than the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a moment, then, as a subtle token of his presence, he left a single, perfectly folded betel-leaf on her bedside table before vanishing into the night.\nIntrigued by the mysterious betel-leaf, Princess Labam spoke of it to no one, but pondered its meaning. A few nights later, the Young Prince, drawn by an irresistible pull, once again used his magic bed to visit her chamber. This time, as she lay in slumber, he gently placed a richly embroidered silk shawl over her, a tangible whisper of his admiration, and again, he departed unseen, leaving her to awaken to another enigmatic gift.\nThe Princess, now certain of a secret admirer, feigned sleep on the Prince's third visit. As he softly approached, she opened her luminous eyes. Startled but emboldened, the Raja's Son finally revealed his identity, his royal lineage, and the depth of his devotion. Gazing into his earnest eyes, Princess Labam, who had already felt an inexplicable connection to her mysterious visitor, accepted his proposal, agreeing to marry him.\nWhen Princess Labam's father, The King, learned of his daughter's secret betrothal to an unknown prince, his royal wrath flared. To test the Young Prince's worth, or rather, to deter him, The King assigned an impossible task: to crush enough oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds to fill the royal reservoir, all within a single day, an endeavor that would usually take months.\nThe Raja's Son, faced with this overwhelming challenge, despaired, but then remembered his promise-bound friend. He quietly summoned the Ant-Raja, who, true to his word, arrived with his entire industrious army. By dawn, the countless ants had meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting the oil and filling the reservoir, leaving The King utterly astonished.\nStill unwilling to accept defeat, The King, in his relentless pursuit to rid himself of the audacious Prince, issued another daunting command. He ordered the Raja's Son to venture into the cursed southern jungles and slay two ferocious demons who had long terrorized his kingdom, believing this task would surely lead to the Prince's demise.\nOnce more, the Young Prince called upon his sworn ally. With a thunderous roar, the mighty Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. Without hesitation, the Tiger charged into the jungle, swiftly engaging the monstrous demons in a brutal, decisive battle. By morning, the Tiger returned, its paws stained, having vanquished both creatures, leaving The King gaping in disbelief at the Prince’s uncanny success.\nHis schemes repeatedly foiled, The King devised a public spectacle for the Prince's next impossible task. He commanded the Raja's Son to beat the great kettle_drum that hung suspended impossibly high in the heavens, a drum that traditionally heralded royal victories, confident that no mortal man could ever reach it.\nThe Raja's Son, undaunted, retrieved the magic bed he had acquired from the Fakirs. Before the astonished eyes of the entire court and kingdom, he mounted the enchanted bed, which ascended majestically into the clear blue sky. With a flourish, he reached the colossal kettle_drum and struck it with a resounding beat, its boom echoing across the land, proving his triumph.\nIn a final, desperate attempt to thwart the marriage, The King presented the Young Prince with a riddle disguised as a task: he must cut down the ancient, unyielding Royal Banyan Tree at the palace gates using only a fragile hatchet made of wax, a task designed to be logically impossible.\nFor the first time, the Prince found himself truly stumped. But Princess Labam, watching from her balcony, had anticipated her father's cunning. She swiftly retrieved a single, shimmering hair from her own head, a strand imbued with ancient magic, and discreetly passed it to the Raja's Son. When he touched the wax hatchet with the magic hair, it transformed, gaining the power to effortlessly slice through the enormous tree.\nWith all trials overcome, The King, left with no alternative but to acknowledge the Prince's valor and destiny, finally gave his blessings.

By morning, the Tiger returned, its paws stained, having vanquished both creatures, leaving The King gaping in disbelief at the Prince’s uncanny success.\n\nSummary:\n\n\nDoers: Tiger\nReceivers (characters): demons\n\n\nFull Story Context:\nIn a prosperous kingdom nestled amidst emerald hills, the wise Rani cherished her only son, the Young Prince, above all else. Daily she would warn him, \"My son, hunt in the north, the south, the east, but never, ever venture to the fourth side, for there lies a secret best left undisturbed, a path to desires that can lead only to peril.\" Yet, her words, though born of love, only piqued the Prince’s youthful curiosity, planting the seed of the forbidden.\nOne sun-drenched morning, unable to resist the lure of the unknown, the Raja's Son defied his mother's solemn interdiction. He rode his swift steed to the forbidden fourth side, where the forest grew thick and mysterious. Deep within its silent depths, he discovered a magnificent Hiraman Parrot, perched on a branch, its feathers shimmering like jewels, speaking in a voice as clear and melodious as a temple bell.\nThe Raja of Parrots, observing the Prince's regal bearing, began to speak of wonders, painting vivid word-pictures of Princess Labam, whose beauty surpassed the moon, whose grace shamed the lotus, and whose wisdom outshone the brightest stars. The parrot's tales ignited an unquenchable fire in the Young Prince’s heart, a fervent desire to see, to meet, and to win this peerless Princess Labam.\nUpon his return, the Prince, filled with a newfound purpose, humbly yet resolutely sought permission from his parents to embark on a quest to find Princess Labam. Though reluctant and heavy-hearted at the thought of their son’s perilous journey, they eventually yielded to his unwavering resolve, equipping him with a sturdy horse, ample provisions, and a pouch of gold coins for his arduous travels.\nAs the Young Prince journeyed through a vast desert, he encountered a colossal army of ants struggling to carry a single grain of rice, their harvest scattered by a cruel wind. Instead of simply stepping over them, he dismounted, gathered the grains, and carefully placed them back in their path. The grateful Ant-Raja, witnessing this act of profound kindness, emerged and promised, \"Noble Prince, for your compassion, I shall repay your goodness when you are in dire need.\"\nLater, traversing a dense jungle, the Raja's Son stumbled upon a fearsome Tiger, roaring in pain, a sharp thorn deeply embedded in its massive paw. Undeterred by fear, the Prince, with gentle hands and a brave heart, knelt and carefully extracted the painful splinter. The Tiger, its eyes softening, licked the Prince's hand in gratitude and vowed, \"My Prince, should peril ever strike, call upon me, and I shall come to your aid, swift and fierce.\"\nOne evening, seeking rest by a banyan tree, the Prince observed four powerful Fakirs squabbling fiercely over their magical possessions: a flying bed, a never-empty alms bag, a truth-telling bowl, and a self-tying rope. Cunningly, the Raja's Son intervened, suggesting a competition to determine who was strongest. While they exerted themselves, he swiftly and silently gathered all four magical objects, mounting the enchanted bed and flying away, leaving the duped Fakirs bewildered and empty-handed.\nFinally, guided by the Fakirs' magic bowl, the Prince arrived at the outskirts of the magnificent city where Princess Labam resided. Disguising his princely attire, he sought shelter, approaching an old woman’s humble dwelling. With a warm smile and a convincing tale, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, an orphan seeking kin, and the kind-hearted old woman, known as Aunty in the neighborhood, welcomed him into her modest home, unaware of his true identity.\nUnder the cloak of darkness, the Raja's Son invoked the magic of his flying bed, ascending to the palace walls and silently entering Princess Labam's chamber. He found her asleep, her beauty even more radiant than the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a moment, then, as a subtle token of his presence, he left a single, perfectly folded betel-leaf on her bedside table before vanishing into the night.\nIntrigued by the mysterious betel-leaf, Princess Labam spoke of it to no one, but pondered its meaning. A few nights later, the Young Prince, drawn by an irresistible pull, once again used his magic bed to visit her chamber. This time, as she lay in slumber, he gently placed a richly embroidered silk shawl over her, a tangible whisper of his admiration, and again, he departed unseen, leaving her to awaken to another enigmatic gift.\nThe Princess, now certain of a secret admirer, feigned sleep on the Prince's third visit. As he softly approached, she opened her luminous eyes. Startled but emboldened, the Raja's Son finally revealed his identity, his royal lineage, and the depth of his devotion. Gazing into his earnest eyes, Princess Labam, who had already felt an inexplicable connection to her mysterious visitor, accepted his proposal, agreeing to marry him.\nWhen Princess Labam's father, The King, learned of his daughter's secret betrothal to an unknown prince, his royal wrath flared. To test the Young Prince's worth, or rather, to deter him, The King assigned an impossible task: to crush enough oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds to fill the royal reservoir, all within a single day, an endeavor that would usually take months.\nThe Raja's Son, faced with this overwhelming challenge, despaired, but then remembered his promise-bound friend. He quietly summoned the Ant-Raja, who, true to his word, arrived with his entire industrious army. By dawn, the countless ants had meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting the oil and filling the reservoir, leaving The King utterly astonished.\nStill unwilling to accept defeat, The King, in his relentless pursuit to rid himself of the audacious Prince, issued another daunting command. He ordered the Raja's Son to venture into the cursed southern jungles and slay two ferocious demons who had long terrorized his kingdom, believing this task would surely lead to the Prince's demise.\nOnce more, the Young Prince called upon his sworn ally. With a thunderous roar, the mighty Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. Without hesitation, the Tiger charged into the jungle, swiftly engaging the monstrous demons in a brutal, decisive battle. By morning, the Tiger returned, its paws stained, having vanquished both creatures, leaving The King gaping in disbelief at the Prince’s uncanny success.\nHis schemes repeatedly foiled, The King devised a public spectacle for the Prince's next impossible task. He commanded the Raja's Son to beat the great kettle_drum that hung suspended impossibly high in the heavens, a drum that traditionally heralded royal victories, confident that no mortal man could ever reach it.\nThe Raja's Son, undaunted, retrieved the magic bed he had acquired from the Fakirs. Before the astonished eyes of the entire court and kingdom, he mounted the enchanted bed, which ascended majestically into the clear blue sky. With a flourish, he reached the colossal kettle_drum and struck it with a resounding beat, its boom echoing across the land, proving his triumph.\nIn a final, desperate attempt to thwart the marriage, The King presented the Young Prince with a riddle disguised as a task: he must cut down the ancient, unyielding Royal Banyan Tree at the palace gates using only a fragile hatchet made of wax, a task designed to be logically impossible.\nFor the first time, the Prince found himself truly stumped. But Princess Labam, watching from her balcony, had anticipated her father's cunning. She swiftly retrieved a single, shimmering hair from her own head, a strand imbued with ancient magic, and discreetly passed it to the Raja's Son. When he touched the wax hatchet with the magic hair, it transformed, gaining the power to effortlessly slice through the enormous tree.\nWith all trials overcome, The King, left with no alternative but to acknowledge the Prince's valor and destiny, finally gave his blessings. A magnificent wedding ceremony was held, uniting the Raja's Son and Princess Labam in joyous matrimony. The hero, with his beautiful bride by his side, returned to his homeland, where they were welcomed with grand celebrations and ruled their kingdom with wisdom and love, living happily ever after.\n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"Tiger\", \"target\": \"demons\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Adversarial\", \"relationship_level2\": \"enemy\", \"sentiment\": \"hostile\"}]}"}

While they exerted themselves, he swiftly and silently gathered all four magical objects, mounting the enchanted bed and flying away, leaving the duped Fakirs bewildered and empty-handed.\nFinally, guided by the Fakirs' magic bowl, the Prince arrived at the outskirts of the magnificent city where Princess Labam resided. Disguising his princely attire, he sought shelter, approaching an old woman’s humble dwelling. With a warm smile and a convincing tale, he introduced himself as her long-lost nephew, an orphan seeking kin, and the kind-hearted old woman, known as Aunty in the neighborhood, welcomed him into her modest home, unaware of his true identity.\nUnder the cloak of darkness, the Raja's Son invoked the magic of his flying bed, ascending to the palace walls and silently entering Princess Labam's chamber. He found her asleep, her beauty even more radiant than the Hiraman Parrot had described. He gazed upon her for a moment, then, as a subtle token of his presence, he left a single, perfectly folded betel-leaf on her bedside table before vanishing into the night.\nIntrigued by the mysterious betel-leaf, Princess Labam spoke of it to no one, but pondered its meaning. A few nights later, the Young Prince, drawn by an irresistible pull, once again used his magic bed to visit her chamber. This time, as she lay in slumber, he gently placed a richly embroidered silk shawl over her, a tangible whisper of his admiration, and again, he departed unseen, leaving her to awaken to another enigmatic gift.\nThe Princess, now certain of a secret admirer, feigned sleep on the Prince's third visit. As he softly approached, she opened her luminous eyes. Startled but emboldened, the Raja's Son finally revealed his identity, his royal lineage, and the depth of his devotion. Gazing into his earnest eyes, Princess Labam, who had already felt an inexplicable connection to her mysterious visitor, accepted his proposal, agreeing to marry him.\nWhen Princess Labam's father, The King, learned of his daughter's secret betrothal to an unknown prince, his royal wrath flared. To test the Young Prince's worth, or rather, to deter him, The King assigned an impossible task: to crush enough oil from a mountain of tiny mustard seeds to fill the royal reservoir, all within a single day, an endeavor that would usually take months.\nThe Raja's Son, faced with this overwhelming challenge, despaired, but then remembered his promise-bound friend. He quietly summoned the Ant-Raja, who, true to his word, arrived with his entire industrious army. By dawn, the countless ants had meticulously crushed every single mustard seed, extracting the oil and filling the reservoir, leaving The King utterly astonished.\nStill unwilling to accept defeat, The King, in his relentless pursuit to rid himself of the audacious Prince, issued another daunting command. He ordered the Raja's Son to venture into the cursed southern jungles and slay two ferocious demons who had long terrorized his kingdom, believing this task would surely lead to the Prince's demise.\nOnce more, the Young Prince called upon his sworn ally. With a thunderous roar, the mighty Tiger appeared, its eyes burning with fierce loyalty. Without hesitation, the Tiger charged into the jungle, swiftly engaging the monstrous demons in a brutal, decisive battle. By morning, the Tiger returned, its paws stained, having vanquished both creatures, leaving The King gaping in disbelief at the Prince’s uncanny success.\nHis schemes repeatedly foiled, The King devised a public spectacle for the Prince's next impossible task. He commanded the Raja's Son to beat the great kettle_drum that hung suspended impossibly high in the heavens, a drum that traditionally heralded royal victories, confident that no mortal man could ever reach it.\nThe Raja's Son, undaunted, retrieved the magic bed he had acquired from the Fakirs. Before the astonished eyes of the entire court and kingdom, he mounted the enchanted bed, which ascended majestically into the clear blue sky. With a flourish, he reached the colossal kettle_drum and struck it with a resounding beat, its boom echoing across the land, proving his triumph.\nIn a final, desperate attempt to thwart the marriage, The King presented the Young Prince with a riddle disguised as a task: he must cut down the ancient, unyielding Royal Banyan Tree at the palace gates using only a fragile hatchet made of wax, a task designed to be logically impossible.\nFor the first time, the Prince found himself truly stumped. But Princess Labam, watching from her balcony, had anticipated her father's cunning. She swiftly retrieved a single, shimmering hair from her own head, a strand imbued with ancient magic, and discreetly passed it to the Raja's Son. When he touched the wax hatchet with the magic hair, it transformed, gaining the power to effortlessly slice through the enormous tree.\nWith all trials overcome, The King, left with no alternative but to acknowledge the Prince's valor and destiny, finally gave his blessings. A magnificent wedding ceremony was held, uniting the Raja's Son and Princess Labam in joyous matrimony. The hero, with his beautiful bride by his side, returned to his homeland, where they were welcomed with grand celebrations and ruled their kingdom with wisdom and love, living happily ever after.\n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"Princess Labam\", \"target\": \"Raja's Son\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Romance\", \"relationship_level2\": \"lover\", \"sentiment\": \"romantic\"}]}"}

A magnificent wedding ceremony was held, uniting the Raja's Son and Princess Labam in joyous matrimony. The hero, with his beautiful bride by his side, returned to his homeland, where they were welcomed with grand celebrations and ruled their kingdom with wisdom and love, living happily ever after.\n\nSummary:\n\n\nDoers: Raja's Son\nReceivers (characters): Princess Labam\n\n\nFull Story Context:\nIn a prosperous kingdom nestled amidst emerald hills, the wise Rani cherished her only son, the Young Prince, above all else. Daily she would warn him, \"My son, hunt in the north, the south, the east, but never, ever venture to the fourth side, for there lies a secret best left undisturbed, a path to desires that can lead only to peril.\" Yet, her words, though born of love, only piqued the Prince’s youthful curiosity, planting the seed of the forbidden.\nOne sun-drenched morning, unable to resist the lure of the unknown, the Raja's Son defied his mother's solemn interdiction. He rode his swift steed to the forbidden fourth side, where the forest grew thick and mysterious. Deep within its silent depths, he discovered a magnificent Hiraman Parrot, perched on a branch, its feathers shimmering like jewels, speaking in a voice as clear and melodious as a temple bell.\nThe Raja of Parrots, observing the Prince's regal bearing, began to speak of wonders, painting vivid word-pictures of Princess Labam, whose beauty surpassed the moon, whose grace shamed the lotus, and whose wisdom outshone the brightest stars. The parrot's tales ignited an unquenchable fire in the Young Prince’s heart, a fervent desire to see, to meet, and to win this peerless Princess Labam.\nUpon his return, the Prince, filled with a newfound purpose, humbly yet resolutely sought permission from his parents to embark on a quest to find Princess Labam. Though reluctant and heavy-hearted at the thought of their son’s perilous journey, they eventually yielded to his unwavering resolve, equipping him with a sturdy horse, ample provisions, and a pouch of gold coins for his arduous travels.\nAs the Young Prince journeyed through a vast desert, he encountered a colossal army of ants struggling to carry a single grain of rice, their harvest scattered by a cruel wind. Instead of simply stepping over them, he dismounted, gathered the grains, and carefully placed them back in their path. The grateful Ant-Raja, witnessing this act of profound kindness, emerged and promised, \"Noble Prince, for your compassion, I shall repay your goodness when you are in dire need.\"\nLater, traversing a dense jungle, the Raja's Son stumbled upon a fearsome Tiger, roaring in pain, a sharp thorn deeply embedded in its massive paw. Undeterred by fear, the Prince, with gentle hands and a brave heart, knelt and carefully extracted the painful splinter. The Tiger, its eyes softening, licked the Prince's hand in gratitude and vowed, \"My Prince, should peril ever strike, call upon me, and I shall come to your aid, swift and fierce.\"\nOne evening, seeking rest by a banyan tree, the Prince observed four powerful Fakirs squabbling fiercely over their magical possessions: a flying bed, a never-empty alms bag, a truth-telling bowl, and a self-tying rope.
