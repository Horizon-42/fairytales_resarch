As the silver threads of age multiplied in his hair and his body grew weary, he decided, in an act of profound trust, to distribute his entire fortune—his fertile lands, a chest of glistening silver rupees, and a handful of precious family jewels—among his two strapping young men, his sons. He believed this would ensure their prosperity and his own peaceful twilight years under their care. However, no sooner had the wealth been divided and registered in their names, than the wretched, selfish ingrates cast off their filial pretense. They relegated their Father to a cramped, dusty corner of the cattle shed, offered him only the coarsest grains and water, and met his gentle pleas with scornful glares and harsh words, leaving the poor Old Man to suffer indignity and hunger. \nWitnessing the Old Man's pitiable state, his loyal friend, a sagacious elder named Gopal, felt his heart ache and his mind churn with a plan. Gopal, known for his sharp wit, promptly acquired two large, sturdy jute bags, which he carefully filled with smooth, weighty river stones. With meticulous care, he sealed them with thick wax and bound them with intricate cords, making them appear like ancient, valuable treasures. Carrying these deceptively heavy bags, Gopal approached the Sons with a solemn face. \"Your venerable Father,\" he declared in a grave whisper, \"in his wisdom, shared a profound secret with me. He spoke of two bags of ancestral gold, buried deep beneath the roots of the ancient Banyan tree, intended for whichever son showed him the most profound love and devotion in his remaining days. He entrusted these tokens of his secret wealth to my keeping.\" As he spoke, Gopal presented the two clinking bags, their apparent weight promising immense riches. \nThe Sons, their hearts swelling with avarice at the prospect of a hidden inheritance, immediately shed their cruel demeanor. The mere whisper of ancestral gold, far exceeding their current wealth, ignited a fierce, though utterly hollow, devotion within them. They retrieved the Old Man from the cattle shed, bathed him with fragrant oils, and offered him the most delicious meals, prepared with a lavishness they had previously denied him. They competed fiercely to serve him, fanning him through the oppressive heat, massaging his tired limbs, and listening with feigned patience to his ancient tales. Each son, eager to be seen as the most filial, showered him with attention, their every action a calculated performance designed to secure the phantom gold hidden beneath the Banyan tree until their Father's very last breath. \nAt last, after months of this elaborate charade of affection, the Poor Old Man, his heart perhaps eased by the brief respite from cruelty, passed away peacefully in his sleep, a faint, knowing smile gracing his lips. The moment the funeral pyre’s ashes had cooled and the rites were concluded, the Sons, abandoning all decorum, rushed to the venerable Banyan tree. With wild abandon, they dug into the earth, their shovels tearing at roots and soil, driven by feverish greed. After hours of relentless digging, their hands blistered and their bodies aching, they finally unearthed the two jute bags. Their hearts pounded with the thrill of imminent wealth as they tore open the seals, only to discover, to their utter horror and incandescent rage, that the bags contained nothing but common, worthless river stones. The wretched, selfish ingrates collapsed in despair, realizing with bitter shame that they had been completely duped, their own avarice having tricked them into providing their Father with comfort in his final days, only to inherit the crushing weight of their own foolishness. \n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"The Sons\", \"target\": \"The Old Man\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Family & Kinship\", \"relationship_level2\": \"parent_child\", \"sentiment\": \"hostile\"}]}"}
