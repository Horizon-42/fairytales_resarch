As the silver threads of age multiplied in his hair and his body grew weary, he decided, in an act of profound trust, to distribute his entire fortune—his fertile lands, a chest of glistening silver rupees, and a handful of precious family jewels—among his two strapping young men, his sons. He believed this would ensure their prosperity and his own peaceful twilight years under their care. However, no sooner had the wealth been divided and registered in their names, than the wretched, selfish ingrates cast off their filial pretense. They relegated their Father to a cramped, dusty corner of the cattle shed, offered him only the coarsest grains and water, and met his gentle pleas with scornful glares and harsh words, leaving the poor Old Man to suffer indignity and hunger. \n\nSummary:\nAn elderly man, after distributing his wealth to his selfish sons, is cruelly abandoned, only for his loyal friend Gopal to trick them into showing false devotion by presenting fake gold bags. The sons, driven by greed, lavish attention on their father until his death, only to discover the \"treasures\" are worthless river stones, revealing their own foolishness and the futility of their avarice.\n\nDoers: The Sons\nReceivers (characters): The Old Man\n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"The Sons\", \"target\": \"The Old Man\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Family & Kinship\", \"relationship_level2\": \"parent_child\", \"sentiment\": \"hostile\"}]}"}

The mere whisper of ancestral gold, far exceeding their current wealth, ignited a fierce, though utterly hollow, devotion within them. They retrieved the Old Man from the cattle shed, bathed him with fragrant oils, and offered him the most delicious meals, prepared with a lavishness they had previously denied him. They competed fiercely to serve him, fanning him through the oppressive heat, massaging his tired limbs, and listening with feigned patience to his ancient tales. Each son, eager to be seen as the most filial, showered him with attention, their every action a calculated performance designed to secure the phantom gold hidden beneath the Banyan tree until their Father's very last breath. \n\nSummary:\nAn elderly man, after distributing his wealth to his selfish sons, is cruelly abandoned, only for his loyal friend Gopal to trick them into showing false devotion by presenting fake gold bags.
