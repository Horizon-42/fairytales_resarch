The Raja had seven beautiful daughters, the youngest and most gentle among them being Princess Balna. The Ranee harbored a deep jealousy towards the princesses, especially Balna, and subjected them to relentless mistreatment, denying them food and forcing them to endure constant hunger, their youthful spirits slowly fading under her harsh tyranny.\nYet, heaven's grace watched over them, for the spirit of their dead mother, ever loving, would not see her daughters suffer. Each day, she manifested a miraculous mango tree laden with ripe fruit just for them, and when The Ranee grew suspicious and had the tree cut down, the spirit of the dead mother then provided a hidden tank filled with rich, creamy milk, ensuring the princesses continued to receive sustenance in secret, much to the Ranee's baffled frustration.\nThe Ranee’s cruelty knew no bounds, and when she discovered the princesses were still alive and well, she spitefully demanded the Raja spill their blood. Tormented by his wife's wicked decree and unable to defy her, yet unwilling to harm his own flesh and blood, The Raja, with a heavy heart, led his seven daughters deep into the densest part of the jungle, leaving them there amidst the echoing calls of wild beasts, hoping fate would be kinder than he could be.\nWandering lost and afraid through the perilous jungle, the seven princesses eventually stumbled upon a magnificent hunting lodge. It was there they were discovered by seven valiant princes, out on a royal hunt, who were captivated by their beauty and grace. A swift and joyful union followed, and each prince took a princess as his bride, with the youngest, most handsome of the Seven Princes, finding his heart's match in the sweet Balna, bringing a fleeting period of happiness to their lives.\nTheir newfound happiness, however, was tragically short-lived. One fateful morning, the Seven Princes ventured out for a grand hunt, promising to return by sunset. But the sun dipped below the horizon, and days turned into weeks, yet their husbands did not return. Unknown to their anxious wives, a malevolent Fakir named Punchkin, master of dark magic, had ensnared the Seven Princes in a powerful enchantment, holding them captive in his hidden domain.\nIt was not long before the nefarious Punchkin, drawn by Balna’s unparalleled beauty, appeared before her. He revealed his mastery over her captured husband and brothers-in-law, demanding that she marry him and become his queen. Balna, steadfast in her devotion and courage, scornfully refused the villainous Fakir's proposal, fueling his dark rage. Enraged by her defiance, Punchkin seized Balna with his magic and forcibly carried her away to his desolate, enchanted palace, holding her captive far from her sisters.\nYears passed, and in Punchkin's hidden palace, Balna gave birth to a brave and spirited son. As he grew, Balna recounted the tale of his lost father and uncles, and the cruel Fakir who held them all captive. Filled with fierce determination and a burning desire for justice, Balna's Son, now a young man, prepared himself for the perilous journey. He took leave of his captive mother and set forth from Punchkin's domain, resolute in his quest to rescue his family and avenge their suffering.\nDuring his journey to discover Punchkin’s weaknesses, Balna's Son sought counsel near the Fakir's cursed kingdom. He encountered a kind and wise woman, Malee's Wife, the gardener’s wife, who understood the dark magic that permeated the land. Knowing the perils of Punchkin’s watchful eyes, Malee's Wife shrewdly helped the prince disguise himself as a humble gardener, providing him with simple clothes and tools, enabling him to gain unnoticed entry into the Fakir's enchanted gardens.\nIn his disguise as a gardener, Balna's Son carefully made his way into the Fakir's palace grounds, eventually finding the chambers where his mother, Balna, was held. Through subtle words and a shared look, he cautiously identified himself to her, revealing his true identity. Overwhelmed with emotion, Balna instantly recognized her valiant son and, with renewed hope, swiftly agreed to concoct a clever scheme to trick Punchkin into revealing the secret of his immortality.\nBalna, feigning affection and a newfound acceptance of her captor, began to shower Punchkin, the Fakir, with flattering words and tender inquiries. She skillfully plied him with questions about his power and the source of his eternal life, declaring that she wished to know so she might forever protect him. Swollen with vanity and blinded by her supposed devotion, Punchkin eventually succumbed to her wiles, boastfully revealing that his soul resided not within his body, but in a small green parrot, hidden within a tiny silver casket, itself nestled inside a brass box, buried beneath seven tanks of water in the heart of a distant, enchanted jungle, guarded by a thousand demons.\nArmed with this vital secret, Balna's Son embarked on the arduous quest to the distant jungle. Along his perilous path, he discovered a nest of eaglets, threatened by a venomous serpent. Without hesitation, the brave prince slayed the serpent, saving the young birds from certain death. Grateful beyond measure, the parent Eagles, mighty creatures of the sky, offered their aid, majestically carrying Balna's Son on their backs across vast rivers and towering mountains, directly to the mystical jungle and the precise location of the hidden parrot.\nFinally, Balna's Son found the parrot, trapped within its boxes, and snatched it from its lair. Returning to Punchkin’s palace, the prince confronted the terrified Fakir, holding the squawking bird aloft. He demanded Punchkin release his uncles, the Seven Princes, from their enchantments. With each squeeze of the parrot, Punchkin shrieked in pain, his magic weakening, until he was forced to restore the Seven Princes to their true forms. Then, with a final, resolute squeeze, Balna’s Son crushed the life out of the parrot, and with a guttural scream, Punchkin, the Fakir, instantly disintegrated into dust, his evil reign finally ended, and all his victims freed.\n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"The Ranee\", \"target\": \"Balna\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Family & Kinship\", \"relationship_level2\": \"parent_child\", \"sentiment\": \"hostile\"}]}"}

The Raja had seven beautiful daughters, the youngest and most gentle among them being Princess Balna. The Ranee harbored a deep jealousy towards the princesses, especially Balna, and subjected them to relentless mistreatment, denying them food and forcing them to endure constant hunger, their youthful spirits slowly fading under her harsh tyranny.\nYet, heaven's grace watched over them, for the spirit of their dead mother, ever loving, would not see her daughters suffer. Each day, she manifested a miraculous mango tree laden with ripe fruit just for them, and when The Ranee grew suspicious and had the tree cut down, the spirit of the dead mother then provided a hidden tank filled with rich, creamy milk, ensuring the princesses continued to receive sustenance in secret, much to the Ranee's baffled frustration.\nThe Ranee’s cruelty knew no bounds, and when she discovered the princesses were still alive and well, she spitefully demanded the Raja spill their blood. Tormented by his wife's wicked decree and unable to defy her, yet unwilling to harm his own flesh and blood, The Raja, with a heavy heart, led his seven daughters deep into the densest part of the jungle, leaving them there amidst the echoing calls of wild beasts, hoping fate would be kinder than he could be.\nWandering lost and afraid through the perilous jungle, the seven princesses eventually stumbled upon a magnificent hunting lodge. It was there they were discovered by seven valiant princes, out on a royal hunt, who were captivated by their beauty and grace. A swift and joyful union followed, and each prince took a princess as his bride, with the youngest, most handsome of the Seven Princes, finding his heart's match in the sweet Balna, bringing a fleeting period of happiness to their lives.\nTheir newfound happiness, however, was tragically short-lived. One fateful morning, the Seven Princes ventured out for a grand hunt, promising to return by sunset. But the sun dipped below the horizon, and days turned into weeks, yet their husbands did not return. Unknown to their anxious wives, a malevolent Fakir named Punchkin, master of dark magic, had ensnared the Seven Princes in a powerful enchantment, holding them captive in his hidden domain.\nIt was not long before the nefarious Punchkin, drawn by Balna’s unparalleled beauty, appeared before her. He revealed his mastery over her captured husband and brothers-in-law, demanding that she marry him and become his queen. Balna, steadfast in her devotion and courage, scornfully refused the villainous Fakir's proposal, fueling his dark rage. Enraged by her defiance, Punchkin seized Balna with his magic and forcibly carried her away to his desolate, enchanted palace, holding her captive far from her sisters.\nYears passed, and in Punchkin's hidden palace, Balna gave birth to a brave and spirited son. As he grew, Balna recounted the tale of his lost father and uncles, and the cruel Fakir who held them all captive. Filled with fierce determination and a burning desire for justice, Balna's Son, now a young man, prepared himself for the perilous journey. He took leave of his captive mother and set forth from Punchkin's domain, resolute in his quest to rescue his family and avenge their suffering.\nDuring his journey to discover Punchkin’s weaknesses, Balna's Son sought counsel near the Fakir's cursed kingdom. He encountered a kind and wise woman, Malee's Wife, the gardener’s wife, who understood the dark magic that permeated the land. Knowing the perils of Punchkin’s watchful eyes, Malee's Wife shrewdly helped the prince disguise himself as a humble gardener, providing him with simple clothes and tools, enabling him to gain unnoticed entry into the Fakir's enchanted gardens.\nIn his disguise as a gardener, Balna's Son carefully made his way into the Fakir's palace grounds, eventually finding the chambers where his mother, Balna, was held. Through subtle words and a shared look, he cautiously identified himself to her, revealing his true identity. Overwhelmed with emotion, Balna instantly recognized her valiant son and, with renewed hope, swiftly agreed to concoct a clever scheme to trick Punchkin into revealing the secret of his immortality.\nBalna, feigning affection and a newfound acceptance of her captor, began to shower Punchkin, the Fakir, with flattering words and tender inquiries. She skillfully plied him with questions about his power and the source of his eternal life, declaring that she wished to know so she might forever protect him. Swollen with vanity and blinded by her supposed devotion, Punchkin eventually succumbed to her wiles, boastfully revealing that his soul resided not within his body, but in a small green parrot, hidden within a tiny silver casket, itself nestled inside a brass box, buried beneath seven tanks of water in the heart of a distant, enchanted jungle, guarded by a thousand demons.\nArmed with this vital secret, Balna's Son embarked on the arduous quest to the distant jungle. Along his perilous path, he discovered a nest of eaglets, threatened by a venomous serpent. Without hesitation, the brave prince slayed the serpent, saving the young birds from certain death. Grateful beyond measure, the parent Eagles, mighty creatures of the sky, offered their aid, majestically carrying Balna's Son on their backs across vast rivers and towering mountains, directly to the mystical jungle and the precise location of the hidden parrot.\nFinally, Balna's Son found the parrot, trapped within its boxes, and snatched it from its lair.

The Raja had seven beautiful daughters, the youngest and most gentle among them being Princess Balna. The Ranee harbored a deep jealousy towards the princesses, especially Balna, and subjected them to relentless mistreatment, denying them food and forcing them to endure constant hunger, their youthful spirits slowly fading under her harsh tyranny.\nYet, heaven's grace watched over them, for the spirit of their dead mother, ever loving, would not see her daughters suffer. Each day, she manifested a miraculous mango tree laden with ripe fruit just for them, and when The Ranee grew suspicious and had the tree cut down, the spirit of the dead mother then provided a hidden tank filled with rich, creamy milk, ensuring the princesses continued to receive sustenance in secret, much to the Ranee's baffled frustration.\nThe Ranee’s cruelty knew no bounds, and when she discovered the princesses were still alive and well, she spitefully demanded the Raja spill their blood. Tormented by his wife's wicked decree and unable to defy her, yet unwilling to harm his own flesh and blood, The Raja, with a heavy heart, led his seven daughters deep into the densest part of the jungle, leaving them there amidst the echoing calls of wild beasts, hoping fate would be kinder than he could be.\nWandering lost and afraid through the perilous jungle, the seven princesses eventually stumbled upon a magnificent hunting lodge. It was there they were discovered by seven valiant princes, out on a royal hunt, who were captivated by their beauty and grace. A swift and joyful union followed, and each prince took a princess as his bride, with the youngest, most handsome of the Seven Princes, finding his heart's match in the sweet Balna, bringing a fleeting period of happiness to their lives.\nTheir newfound happiness, however, was tragically short-lived. One fateful morning, the Seven Princes ventured out for a grand hunt, promising to return by sunset. But the sun dipped below the horizon, and days turned into weeks, yet their husbands did not return. Unknown to their anxious wives, a malevolent Fakir named Punchkin, master of dark magic, had ensnared the Seven Princes in a powerful enchantment, holding them captive in his hidden domain.\nIt was not long before the nefarious Punchkin, drawn by Balna’s unparalleled beauty, appeared before her. He revealed his mastery over her captured husband and brothers-in-law, demanding that she marry him and become his queen. Balna, steadfast in her devotion and courage, scornfully refused the villainous Fakir's proposal, fueling his dark rage. Enraged by her defiance, Punchkin seized Balna with his magic and forcibly carried her away to his desolate, enchanted palace, holding her captive far from her sisters.\nYears passed, and in Punchkin's hidden palace, Balna gave birth to a brave and spirited son. As he grew, Balna recounted the tale of his lost father and uncles, and the cruel Fakir who held them all captive. Filled with fierce determination and a burning desire for justice, Balna's Son, now a young man, prepared himself for the perilous journey. He took leave of his captive mother and set forth from Punchkin's domain, resolute in his quest to rescue his family and avenge their suffering.\nDuring his journey to discover Punchkin’s weaknesses, Balna's Son sought counsel near the Fakir's cursed kingdom. He encountered a kind and wise woman, Malee's Wife, the gardener’s wife, who understood the dark magic that permeated the land. Knowing the perils of Punchkin’s watchful eyes, Malee's Wife shrewdly helped the prince disguise himself as a humble gardener, providing him with simple clothes and tools, enabling him to gain unnoticed entry into the Fakir's enchanted gardens.\nIn his disguise as a gardener, Balna's Son carefully made his way into the Fakir's palace grounds, eventually finding the chambers where his mother, Balna, was held.

Knowing the perils of Punchkin’s watchful eyes, Malee's Wife shrewdly helped the prince disguise himself as a humble gardener, providing him with simple clothes and tools, enabling him to gain unnoticed entry into the Fakir's enchanted gardens.\nIn his disguise as a gardener, Balna's Son carefully made his way into the Fakir's palace grounds, eventually finding the chambers where his mother, Balna, was held. Through subtle words and a shared look, he cautiously identified himself to her, revealing his true identity. Overwhelmed with emotion, Balna instantly recognized her valiant son and, with renewed hope, swiftly agreed to concoct a clever scheme to trick Punchkin into revealing the secret of his immortality.\nBalna, feigning affection and a newfound acceptance of her captor, began to shower Punchkin, the Fakir, with flattering words and tender inquiries. She skillfully plied him with questions about his power and the source of his eternal life, declaring that she wished to know so she might forever protect him. Swollen with vanity and blinded by her supposed devotion, Punchkin eventually succumbed to her wiles, boastfully revealing that his soul resided not within his body, but in a small green parrot, hidden within a tiny silver casket, itself nestled inside a brass box, buried beneath seven tanks of water in the heart of a distant, enchanted jungle, guarded by a thousand demons.\nArmed with this vital secret, Balna's Son embarked on the arduous quest to the distant jungle. Along his perilous path, he discovered a nest of eaglets, threatened by a venomous serpent. Without hesitation, the brave prince slayed the serpent, saving the young birds from certain death. Grateful beyond measure, the parent Eagles, mighty creatures of the sky, offered their aid, majestically carrying Balna's Son on their backs across vast rivers and towering mountains, directly to the mystical jungle and the precise location of the hidden parrot.\nFinally, Balna's Son found the parrot, trapped within its boxes, and snatched it from its lair. Returning to Punchkin’s palace, the prince confronted the terrified Fakir, holding the squawking bird aloft. He demanded Punchkin release his uncles, the Seven Princes, from their enchantments. With each squeeze of the parrot, Punchkin shrieked in pain, his magic weakening, until he was forced to restore the Seven Princes to their true forms. Then, with a final, resolute squeeze, Balna’s Son crushed the life out of the parrot, and with a guttural scream, Punchkin, the Fakir, instantly disintegrated into dust, his evil reign finally ended, and all his victims freed.\n\n\nRelationship Categories (MUST select from these exact options):\n- Family & Kinship: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family\n- Romance: lover\n- Hierarchy: ruler_subject, master_servant, mentor_student, commander_subordinate\n- Social & Alliance: friend, ally, colleague\n- Adversarial: enemy, rival\n- Neutral: stranger\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 MUST be exactly one of: \"Family & Kinship\", \"Romance\", \"Hierarchy\", \"Social & Alliance\", \"Adversarial\", \"Neutral\"\n- relationship_level2 MUST be from the corresponding level1 options (e.g., if level1 is \"Family & Kinship\", level2 must be one of: parent_child, sibling, spouse, extended_family)\n- Do NOT invent new relationship types\n\nSentiment (select one):\n- romantic (high positive), positive (friendly), neutral (indifferent)\n- negative (dislike), fearful (submissive), hostile (high negative)\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"relationships\": [\n    {\n      \"agent\": \"doer name\",\n      \"target\": \"receiver name\",\n      \"relationship_level1\": \"exact category name from list above\",\n      \"relationship_level2\": \"exact type from corresponding category options\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"one of: romantic, positive, neutral, negative, fearful, hostile\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\nCRITICAL: \n- relationship_level1 and relationship_level2 MUST use exact strings from the guide above\n- If receivers are not characters (are objects), return empty relationships array []\n- Multiple relationships possible if there are multiple doer-receiver pairs\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"relationships\": [{\"agent\": \"Balna's Son\", \"target\": \"Punchkin\", \"relationship_level1\": \"Adversarial\", \"relationship_level2\": \"enemy\", \"sentiment\": \"hostile\"}]}"}
