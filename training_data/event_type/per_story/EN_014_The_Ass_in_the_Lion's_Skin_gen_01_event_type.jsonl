He had acquired a fearsome lion's skin, complete with mane and claws, and with it, he cloaked his humble beast. Each evening, under the cloak of twilight, the Hawker would lead the disguised ass into the lush, ripe fields belonging to the villagers. The simple watchmen, patrolling the perimeters with their flickering oil lamps, would glimpse the majestic silhouette and hear the rustle of grass, instantly mistaking the creature for a savage king of the jungle. Their hearts seizing with terror, they would flee, leaving the imposter lion to graze freely and devour the precious crops throughout the night.\n\nSummary:\nA cunning Hawker deceives villagers by disguising his ass as a lion to steal their crops, exploiting their fear. When the villagers finally confront the \"lion,\" the ass's bray exposes the trick, leading to its brutal punishment.

Fear gripped their hearts, but as hunger began to pinch and their livelihoods dwindled, a desperate courage bloomed within them. Under the guidance of their elders, the villagers resolved to drive the predator away.

The sudden, overwhelming assault of sound was too much for the poor ass, which was peacefully munching on a patch of sweet tender shoots. Its carefully maintained disguise, its imitation of a fearsome predator, shattered under the weight of pure, unadulterated panic. Forgetting entirely the part it was meant to play, the terrified animal threw its head back and let out a loud, unmistakable bray—a harsh, ragged \"Hee-haw!
