The hall shimmered with divine light, tables groaned under the weight of ambrosial sweets, fragrant rice, and countless delicacies prepared with celestial love. Sun, with his radiant hunger, consumed dish after dish, his plate never empty, his focus entirely on his own indulgence. Wind, equally self-absorbed, darted from one delicacy to another, gulping down essences and devouring morsels with no thought beyond his fleeting desires. But Gentle Moon, ever thoughtful of her Mother Star, discreetly wrapped portions of the finest sweets and the most fragrant fruits in a large, cool lotus leaf, carefully preserving them amidst the joyous revelry, ensuring her mother would not be forgotten.\n\nSummary:\nThe story follows the three celestial children of the Mother Star—Sun, Wind, and Moon—who attend a lavish feast. Sun and Wind indulge selfishly, leaving nothing for their mother, while Moon selflessly saves delicacies for her. Mother Star punishes Sun with relentless heat and Wind with scorching dryness, rewarding Moon with a cool, serene light to balance the world's harshness.\n\n\nKey Propp Functions (select one code):\n- alpha: Initial Situation (intro of hero/family)\n- beta: Absentation (authority leaves)\n- gamma: Interdiction (hero warned)\n- delta: Violation (rule broken)\n- epsilon: Reconnaissance (villain gathers info)\n- zeta: Delivery (villain gets info)\n- eta: Trickery (villain deceives)\n- theta: Complicity (victim submits)\n- A: Villainy (villain causes harm) [Driver Type 1]\n- a: Lack (family lacks something) [Driver Type 2]\n- B: Mediation (hero dispatched)\n- C: Counteraction (hero decides)\n- arrow_up: Departure (hero leaves)\n- D: 1st Function of Donor (hero tested)\n- E: Hero's Reaction (responds to test)\n- F: Receipt of Agent (acquires magical item)\n- G: Guidance (transferred to location)\n- H: Struggle (combat with villain)\n- J: Branding (hero wounded/marked)\n- I: Victory (villain defeated)\n- K: Liquidation (lack/villainy resolved)\n- arrow_down: Return (hero returns)\n- Pr: Pursuit (hero pursued)\n- Rs: Rescue (hero rescued)\n- o: Unrecognized Arrival (disguised)\n- L: Unfounded Claims (false hero claims)\n- M: Difficult Task (task proposed)\n- N: Solution (task resolved)\n- Q: Recognition (hero recognized)\n- Ex: Exposure (false hero/villain exposed)\n- T: Transfiguration (new appearance/status)\n- U: Punishment (villain punished)\n- W: Wedding (ultimate reward)\n- OTHER: If none fit\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"Propp function code (e.g., 'A', 'a', 'B', or 'OTHER')\",\n  \"description_general\": \"general description (e.g., 'monster kills hero's family')\",\n  \"description_specific\": \"specific description (e.g., 'wolf eats Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother')\"\n}\n\nNote: If the event fits no specific Propp function, use \"OTHER\".\nCombine the two descriptions with semicolon: \"general;specific\"\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"event_type\": \"Initial Situation\", \"description_general\": \"The children attend a feast\", \"description_specific\": \"Sun and Wind gorge themselves, but Moon saves food for their mother.\"}"}
