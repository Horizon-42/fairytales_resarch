Unable to afford fodder for his beast, Govinda devised a cunning plan. He found the discarded, moth-eaten skin of a magnificent lion, which he carefully draped over his docile ass, tying it securely to make it appear like a fearsome predator. Each evening, under the cloak of twilight, he would lead the disguised ass into the lush paddy fields bordering a prosperous village, whose watchmen usually guarded the ripening crops. The sight of what appeared to be a lion, stalking silently through the moonlit fields, sent shivers down the spines of the fearful villagers, who dared not approach, allowing the ass to graze freely and fatten itself on their precious harvest, night after night.\n\nSummary:\nGovinda, a resourceful hawker, disguises his starving ass as a lion to steal villagers' crops, exploiting their fear. When the villagers confront the \"lion\" with noise, the ass's braying exposes its true identity, leading to its brutal demise. The story underscores the folly of pretense, as the ass's own voice betrays its deception, leaving Govinda heartbroken. The villagers' initial fear turns to anger, highlighting the consequences of hubris and the inevitability of truth.\n\n\nKey Propp Functions (select one code):\n- alpha: Initial Situation (intro of hero/family)\n- beta: Absentation (authority leaves)\n- gamma: Interdiction (hero warned)\n- delta: Violation (rule broken)\n- epsilon: Reconnaissance (villain gathers info)\n- zeta: Delivery (villain gets info)\n- eta: Trickery (villain deceives)\n- theta: Complicity (victim submits)\n- A: Villainy (villain causes harm) [Driver Type 1]\n- a: Lack (family lacks something) [Driver Type 2]\n- B: Mediation (hero dispatched)\n- C: Counteraction (hero decides)\n- arrow_up: Departure (hero leaves)\n- D: 1st Function of Donor (hero tested)\n- E: Hero's Reaction (responds to test)\n- F: Receipt of Agent (acquires magical item)\n- G: Guidance (transferred to location)\n- H: Struggle (combat with villain)\n- J: Branding (hero wounded/marked)\n- I: Victory (villain defeated)\n- K: Liquidation (lack/villainy resolved)\n- arrow_down: Return (hero returns)\n- Pr: Pursuit (hero pursued)\n- Rs: Rescue (hero rescued)\n- o: Unrecognized Arrival (disguised)\n- L: Unfounded Claims (false hero claims)\n- M: Difficult Task (task proposed)\n- N: Solution (task resolved)\n- Q: Recognition (hero recognized)\n- Ex: Exposure (false hero/villain exposed)\n- T: Transfiguration (new appearance/status)\n- U: Punishment (villain punished)\n- W: Wedding (ultimate reward)\n- OTHER: If none fit\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"Propp function code (e.g., 'A', 'a', 'B', or 'OTHER')\",\n  \"description_general\": \"general description (e.g., 'monster kills hero's family')\",\n  \"description_specific\": \"specific description (e.g., 'wolf eats Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother')\"\n}\n\nNote: If the event fits no specific Propp function, use \"OTHER\".\nCombine the two descriptions with semicolon: \"general;specific\"\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"event_type\": \"TRICKERY\", \"description_general\": \"The hawker uses a lion's skin to disguise the ass, allowing it to graze freely by scaring off guards.\", \"description_specific\": \"\"}"}

Their murmurs of discontent eventually reached the ears of the village elders and the head watchman, who convened a council under the great banyan tree. \"We cannot let this lion devour our livelihood!\" declared a brave farmer, his voice trembling with a mix of fear and resolve. Galvanized by their collective grievance, the villagers decided to take a stand. They armed themselves not with weapons, but with whatever would make the loudest clamour: drums, conch shells, metal plates, and their own booming voices, agreeing to march towards the fields at dawn, hoping to scare away the terrifying creature with an overwhelming din.\n\nSummary:\nGovinda, a resourceful hawker, disguises his starving ass as a lion to steal villagers' crops, exploiting their fear.

Suddenly, a cacophony erupted – the booming of drums, the wailing of conch shells, the clanging of metal, and a thousand human shouts pierced the morning stillness. The disguised ass, startled by the unprecedented assault of sound, forgot its predatory role entirely. Overcome with instinctive terror and the familiar call of its own kind in such distress, it threw its head back and let out a series of loud, unmistakable \"Hee-haw!

It was then that a venerable peasant, known throughout the region as the Wise Man, a Bodhisatta, stepped forward, his eyes twinkling with ancient wisdom. He had observed the strange \"lion\" for several nights from his humble abode and suspected a deception. \"My dear friends,\" he announced calmly, his voice carrying authority, \"Fear not! What you behold is no king of the jungle, but merely a common ass, cloaked in the skin of a lion.

They felt foolish and enraged at having been so easily deceived. Shouts of \"Deceiver! Impostor!\" rose from the crowd. Forgetting their earlier terror, they surged forward, grabbing their stout bamboo staffs and rusty hoes. They fell upon the braying ass with a fury born of wounded pride and plundered crops.
