Among them was the Clever Merchant, their respected Leader, whose quick wit was as renowned as his exquisite silks. As the afternoon sun beat down relentlessly, a fearsome cry split the air. From behind a thicket of thorny scrub, three burly figures emerged, the notorious robbers who styled themselves the \"Three Monarchs\" of the highway. With menacing clubs and glinting daggers, they ambushed the unsuspecting traders, swiftly disarming them, stripping them of their rich turbans, fine kurtas, and even their humble dhotis, leaving them bare and vulnerable on the dusty ground beside their plundered wares.\n\nSummary:\nA caravan of cloth merchants, led by the Clever Merchant, is ambushed by the boastful Three Robbers, who strip them of their goods and force them into a humiliating dance. Using a coded song, the Clever Merchant signals his fellow traders to attack, overpowering the robbers with coordinated bravery and reclaiming their stolen belongings. The merchants emerge victorious, celebrated as heroes for outwitting their oppressors and turning despair into triumph. Their tale becomes a cautionary reminder of humility and cunning.\n\n\nKey Propp Functions (select one code):\n- alpha: Initial Situation (intro of hero/family)\n- beta: Absentation (authority leaves)\n- gamma: Interdiction (hero warned)\n- delta: Violation (rule broken)\n- epsilon: Reconnaissance (villain gathers info)\n- zeta: Delivery (villain gets info)\n- eta: Trickery (villain deceives)\n- theta: Complicity (victim submits)\n- A: Villainy (villain causes harm) [Driver Type 1]\n- a: Lack (family lacks something) [Driver Type 2]\n- B: Mediation (hero dispatched)\n- C: Counteraction (hero decides)\n- arrow_up: Departure (hero leaves)\n- D: 1st Function of Donor (hero tested)\n- E: Hero's Reaction (responds to test)\n- F: Receipt of Agent (acquires magical item)\n- G: Guidance (transferred to location)\n- H: Struggle (combat with villain)\n- J: Branding (hero wounded/marked)\n- I: Victory (villain defeated)\n- K: Liquidation (lack/villainy resolved)\n- arrow_down: Return (hero returns)\n- Pr: Pursuit (hero pursued)\n- Rs: Rescue (hero rescued)\n- o: Unrecognized Arrival (disguised)\n- L: Unfounded Claims (false hero claims)\n- M: Difficult Task (task proposed)\n- N: Solution (task resolved)\n- Q: Recognition (hero recognized)\n- Ex: Exposure (false hero/villain exposed)\n- T: Transfiguration (new appearance/status)\n- U: Punishment (villain punished)\n- W: Wedding (ultimate reward)\n- OTHER: If none fit\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"Propp function code (e.g., 'A', 'a', 'B', or 'OTHER')\",\n  \"description_general\": \"general description (e.g., 'monster kills hero's family')\",\n  \"description_specific\": \"specific description (e.g., 'wolf eats Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother')\"\n}\n\nNote: If the event fits no specific Propp function, use \"OTHER\".\nCombine the two descriptions with semicolon: \"general;specific\"\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"event_type\": \"VILLAINY\", \"description_general\": \"The robbers ambush the merchants and strip them of all wealth and clothing.\", \"description_specific\": \"\"}"}

Their leader, a corpulent man with a scarred face, leered at the shivering merchants. \"Ha! What a pitiful sight!\" he bellowed. \"But even plucked pigeons can dance, can they not? Amuse us, you wretched traders! Dance for your masters!\" And so, with taunts and prods, the robbers forced the humiliated merchants to perform a grotesque dance, their bare feet shuffling awkwardly in the dust, their hearts heavy with despair and the sting of injustice.\n\nSummary:\nA caravan of cloth merchants, led by the Clever Merchant, is ambushed by the boastful Three Robbers, who strip them of their goods and force them into a humiliating dance.

He noticed their arrogance, their distraction, and the slight weariness in their posture from their drunken revelry. A cunning plan sparked in his mind. With a deep breath, he began to sing, his voice carrying a melancholic tune that seemed to lament their plight, yet within its rhythm, he wove words understood only by his fellow Traders. \"Erith, enty, eno, the wind it blows so low,\" he crooned, his eyes subtly flicking towards the nearest robber. \"Erith, enty, eno, a grip upon the foe! When the second 'eno' rings, each man to battle springs!\" The Ten Cloth Merchants, knowing their Leader's ways, recognized the ancient guild jargon, their eyes widening with a glimmer of desperate hope.\n\nSummary:\nA caravan of cloth merchants, led by the Clever Merchant, is ambushed by the boastful Three Robbers, who strip them of their goods and force them into a humiliating dance.

Like a sudden gust of wind, they moved as one, their naked bodies surprisingly agile. One merchant tripped a robber with his foot, another seized a discarded club, and a third, with a surge of strength, tackled a villain, causing him to drop his dagger.
