He spoke of an incarnation as a magnificent White Crane, known for his keen intellect and boundless compassion, who resided gracefully by a tranquil lotus pond, his pure white feathers gleaming under the benevolent Indian sun, always observing the intricate dance of life and karma unfolding around him.\n\nSummary:\nIn a past life, the Bodhisatta, as a White Crane, saves a dying Lion (Devadatta) by removing a bone lodged in his throat, demanding a promise of safety. The Lion, however, betrays trust with arrogance, rejecting gratitude and threatening the Crane.
