With each squeeze of the parrot, Punchkin shrieked in pain, his magic weakening, until he was forced to restore the Seven Princes to their true forms. Then, with a final, resolute squeeze, Balna’s Son crushed the life out of the parrot, and with a guttural scream, Punchkin, the Fakir, instantly disintegrated into dust, his evil reign finally ended, and all his victims freed.\n\nSummary:\nIn a kingdom ruled by a cruel Ranee, seven princesses, especially gentle Balna, endure harsh mistreatment until their late mother's spirit provides sustenance through magical means.
