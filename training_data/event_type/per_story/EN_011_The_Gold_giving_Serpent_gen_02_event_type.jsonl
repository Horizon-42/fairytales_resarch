One sweltering afternoon, while tending his parched patch of land, he noticed a magnificent cobra, its hood spread wide, coiled regally atop an old anthill at the edge of his field. Believing it to be the powerful Kshetradevata, the Guardian Deity of the Field, responsible for the land's fortunes, Haridatta's heart swelled with reverence and a desperate plea. He hurried home, fetched a bowl of cool, fresh milk, and humbly offered it to the majestic serpent, bowing low and imploring for bountiful crops and an end to his family's persistent hardship.\n\nSummary:\nHaridatta, a poor Brahman, offers milk to a cobra he believes is a deity, earning gold coins in return and lifting his family's fortunes. His greedy son, however, betrays the serpent by killing it, only to be fatally poisoned by its venom. The serpent leaves Haridatta a final pearl, condemning him to leave the field, as greed has irrevocably shattered their bond.

Overwhelmed with gratitude and awe, he understood that the Serpent Deity had accepted his offering and blessed him. From that day forward, Haridatta faithfully placed a bowl of milk at the anthill each morning, and without fail, found another precious gold coin in its place.

The young man, observing his father's daily ritual and the sudden influx of wealth, began to harbor dark thoughts. His mind, clouded by avarice, dismissed the notion of divine generosity. Instead, he concluded with greedy certainty that the entire anthill must be a secret repository of immense gold, and the Serpent was merely a guardian who, once removed, would yield a treasure beyond measure. He began to plot, envisioning himself seizing the entire hoard at once, consumed by a desire that eclipsed all reason and reverence.\n\nSummary:\nHaridatta, a poor Brahman, offers milk to a cobra he believes is a deity, earning gold coins in return and lifting his family's fortunes.

Armed with a heavy club, he crept stealthily towards the sacred anthill. As the majestic Serpent emerged from its dwelling to receive its customary offering, the son struck viciously, aiming a crushing blow at its head. The blow landed, but the resilient Serpent, though injured and enraged by the treacherous attack, was not killed. With a lightning-fast counterstrike born of pain and self-preservation, it sank its venomous fangs deep into the young man's arm. The son shrieked once, then collapsed, the potent venom coursing through his veins, extinguishing his life and his wicked ambitions in a matter of moments.\n\nSummary:\nHaridatta, a poor Brahman, offers milk to a cobra he believes is a deity, earning gold coins in return and lifting his family's fortunes.

Despite his sorrow, he knew the fault lay with his son's greed. The next day, with a heavy heart and trembling hands, Haridatta once more placed a bowl of milk before the anthill, hoping to appease the Serpent and salvage their fractured bond. The Serpent emerged, not with the usual placid demeanor, but with sorrow in its eyes, its voice a melancholic hiss. It spoke of how trust, once shattered by such a cruel act, could never truly heal. The pain of the attack, and the subsequent death of Haridatta's own blood, had created an unbridgeable chasm between them, making their previous relationship an impossibility.\n\nSummary:\nHaridatta, a poor Brahman, offers milk to a cobra he believes is a deity, earning gold coins in return and lifting his family's fortunes.
