From his vantage point, the kitchen below offered a tantalizing spectacle: great brass pots simmering with lentils, mounds of fragrant rice, and, most alluring of all, trays of freshly prepared fish, gleaming with spices. A deep hunger, not just for food but for easy acquisition, stirred within the Greedy Crow, and he began to scheme on how he might gain access to such a perpetual feast.\n\nSummary:\nMr. Crow, driven by greed, deceives the compassionate Pigeon into gaining access to a rich merchant’s kitchen, where he secretly steals food. When caught by the cook, Govind, and confronted by the Pigeon’s wisdom, the Crow faces punishment and a bitter downfall, ultimately dying from his insatiable desires.
