One day, after a particularly fortunate begging round, he found himself with a small surplus of rice—just enough to fill a modest earthen pot. With meticulous care, Svabhavakripana hung the pot from a rafter directly above his sleeping mat, securing it with an old, knotted rope. He gazed at the pot, his eyes gleaming with a strange mixture of contentment and avarice, the precious grains representing not just a meal, but the seed of a grander future.\n\nSummary:\nSvabhavakripana, a miserly man, hoards a small pot of rice, envisioning a future of wealth through calculated trades and acquisitions. His fantasies of prosperity and family life spiral into obsession, leading him to accidentally shatter the pot with a kick, destroying his meager resources.

With that profit, I shall buy more rice, much more, and trade it in the bustling market for even greater gains. Soon, I will have enough silver to purchase a flock of goats, then a herd of cows, whose milk and offspring will fetch me a fortune in gold.
