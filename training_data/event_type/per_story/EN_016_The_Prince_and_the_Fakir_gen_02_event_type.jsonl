Despite all prayers and sacrifices, his queen remained barren. One day, a gaunt, enigmatic Fakir, his eyes burning with unnatural fire, appeared at the palace gates. He offered the despairing King a potent boon: two sons would grace his royal household, but in return, the King must promise to surrender the elder one to the Fakir's keeping when the time came. Overcome by the desperate longing for an heir, the King, with a heavy heart, agreed to the Fakir's chilling terms, sealing the pact with a solemn vow.\n\nSummary:\nA childless king, desperate for an heir, strikes a deadly pact with a mysterious Fakir, who demands his firstborn in exchange for two sons.

Recognizing his long-lost firstborn, the Father wept tears of joy, embracing the Prince and recounting the Fakir's treachery. The Traveller Prince, now revealed as the true King's Son and heir, was celebrated by both kingdoms. The Princess, now fully understanding her earlier misjudgment, joyfully accepted his hand, and the Prince was crowned King, inheriting both his birthright and his newfound kingdom.\n\nSummary:\nA childless king, desperate for an heir, strikes a deadly pact with a mysterious Fakir, who demands his firstborn in exchange for two sons. When the king deceitfully substitutes slaves, the Fakir exposes the lie via ants, seizing the true prince, who escapes, defeats the Fakir, and frees magical creatures. The prince later reunites with his father, proves his worth through a legendary hunt, and ascends as king, winning the heart of the princess and uniting two realms.\n\n\nKey Propp Functions (select one code):\n- alpha: Initial Situation (intro of hero/family)\n- beta: Absentation (authority leaves)\n- gamma: Interdiction (hero warned)\n- delta: Violation (rule broken)\n- epsilon: Reconnaissance (villain gathers info)\n- zeta: Delivery (villain gets info)\n- eta: Trickery (villain deceives)\n- theta: Complicity (victim submits)\n- A: Villainy (villain causes harm) [Driver Type 1]\n- a: Lack (family lacks something) [Driver Type 2]\n- B: Mediation (hero dispatched)\n- C: Counteraction (hero decides)\n- arrow_up: Departure (hero leaves)\n- D: 1st Function of Donor (hero tested)\n- E: Hero's Reaction (responds to test)\n- F: Receipt of Agent (acquires magical item)\n- G: Guidance (transferred to location)\n- H: Struggle (combat with villain)\n- J: Branding (hero wounded/marked)\n- I: Victory (villain defeated)\n- K: Liquidation (lack/villainy resolved)\n- arrow_down: Return (hero returns)\n- Pr: Pursuit (hero pursued)\n- Rs: Rescue (hero rescued)\n- o: Unrecognized Arrival (disguised)\n- L: Unfounded Claims (false hero claims)\n- M: Difficult Task (task proposed)\n- N: Solution (task resolved)\n- Q: Recognition (hero recognized)\n- Ex: Exposure (false hero/villain exposed)\n- T: Transfiguration (new appearance/status)\n- U: Punishment (villain punished)\n- W: Wedding (ultimate reward)\n- OTHER: If none fit\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"Propp function code (e.g., 'A', 'a', 'B', or 'OTHER')\",\n  \"description_general\": \"general description (e.g., 'monster kills hero's family')\",\n  \"description_specific\": \"specific description (e.g., 'wolf eats Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother')\"\n}\n\nNote: If the event fits no specific Propp function, use \"OTHER\".\nCombine the two descriptions with semicolon: \"general;specific\"\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"event_type\": \"TRANSFIGURATION\", \"description_general\": \"The Prince reveals his true identity and is given the kingdom.\", \"description_specific\": \"\"}"}
