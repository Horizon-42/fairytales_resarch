His royal council meetings often stretched for hours, not due to complex state matters, but because the King would digress into endless anecdotes, opinions, and pronouncements, often repeating himself. This garrulousness often left his ministers, including his wise adviser, the Bodisat—who was the Future Buddha—weary and unable to present urgent matters effectively. The Bodisat observed this with quiet concern, knowing that a king's words held great weight and should be carefully considered, not carelessly scattered like grains of sand.\n\nSummary:\nIn the ancient city of Varanasi, King Brahma-datta’s excessive speech frustrated his wise adviser, the Bodisat, who later used a parable to warn him. The story of the Talkative Tortoise, who fell to his death after breaking a vow of silence while being carried by Hamsas, illustrated the peril of uncontrolled speech.

As the hot season intensified, their beloved pond began to shrink, its once-lush lilies wilting under the sun. The Hamsas, recalling the abundant waters and sweet fruits of the Golden Cave in the distant Himalayas, decided it was time to migrate.

Each wild duck took one end of the stick firmly in its beak, their powerful wings ready for the long journey. The Tortoise, with a determined grip, clamped his jaws around the middle of the stick. With a synchronized beat of their wings, they lifted off the drying pond, ascending gracefully into the vast, azure sky.

Unable to hold his tongue for even another moment, he opened his mouth wide to speak, intending to address the villagers below.
