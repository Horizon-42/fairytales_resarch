The grateful King, certain of Harisarman's unparalleled clairvoyance, bestowed upon him vast estates, a magnificent palace adorned with precious gems, and appointed him as the royal astrologer and chief advisor—a position of immense power, prestige, and endless riches. Harisarman, the once-ignored Brahmin, lived out his days in permanent honor and profound wealth, his remarkable journey from poverty to power a testament to wit, courage, and an astonishing series of cosmic coincidences.\n\nSummary:\nHarisarman, a poor Brahmin overlooked in Pataliputra, steals a prized horse from the wealthy Sthuladatta to gain recognition, later falsely claiming divine insight to become a revered sage. When challenged by the king to reveal hidden treasures, he outsmarts the court by cryptically naming a frog in a jar, leveraging his childhood nickname to prove his \"clairvoyance.\" His wit and a series of cosmic coincidences elevate him to royal favor, transforming him from a destitute scholar to a powerful advisor, symbolizing triumph over social injustice through cunning and fate.\n\n\nKey Propp Functions (select one code):\n- alpha: Initial Situation (intro of hero/family)\n- beta: Absentation (authority leaves)\n- gamma: Interdiction (hero warned)\n- delta: Violation (rule broken)\n- epsilon: Reconnaissance (villain gathers info)\n- zeta: Delivery (villain gets info)\n- eta: Trickery (villain deceives)\n- theta: Complicity (victim submits)\n- A: Villainy (villain causes harm) [Driver Type 1]\n- a: Lack (family lacks something) [Driver Type 2]\n- B: Mediation (hero dispatched)\n- C: Counteraction (hero decides)\n- arrow_up: Departure (hero leaves)\n- D: 1st Function of Donor (hero tested)\n- E: Hero's Reaction (responds to test)\n- F: Receipt of Agent (acquires magical item)\n- G: Guidance (transferred to location)\n- H: Struggle (combat with villain)\n- J: Branding (hero wounded/marked)\n- I: Victory (villain defeated)\n- K: Liquidation (lack/villainy resolved)\n- arrow_down: Return (hero returns)\n- Pr: Pursuit (hero pursued)\n- Rs: Rescue (hero rescued)\n- o: Unrecognized Arrival (disguised)\n- L: Unfounded Claims (false hero claims)\n- M: Difficult Task (task proposed)\n- N: Solution (task resolved)\n- Q: Recognition (hero recognized)\n- Ex: Exposure (false hero/villain exposed)\n- T: Transfiguration (new appearance/status)\n- U: Punishment (villain punished)\n- W: Wedding (ultimate reward)\n- OTHER: If none fit\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"event_type\": \"Propp function code (e.g., 'A', 'a', 'B', or 'OTHER')\",\n  \"description_general\": \"general description (e.g., 'monster kills hero's family')\",\n  \"description_specific\": \"specific description (e.g., 'wolf eats Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother')\"\n}\n\nNote: If the event fits no specific Propp function, use \"OTHER\".\nCombine the two descriptions with semicolon: \"general;specific\"\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"event_type\": \"TRANSFIGURATION\", \"description_general\": \"Harisarman is permanently honored and enriched.\", \"description_specific\": \"\"}"}
