His court often stretched late into the night, not due to complex affairs of state, but because the King would hold forth on every conceivable subject, leaving his ministers exhausted and pressing matters delayed.

Unable to hold his tongue for even another moment, he opened his mouth wide to speak, intending to address the villagers below.
