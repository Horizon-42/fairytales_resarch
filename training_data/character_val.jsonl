It was then that a venerable peasant, known throughout the region as the Wise Man, a Bodhisatta, stepped forward, his eyes twinkling with ancient wisdom. He had observed the strange \"lion\" for several nights from his humble abode and suspected a deception. \"My dear friends,\" he announced calmly, his voice carrying authority, \"Fear not! What you behold is no king of the jungle, but merely a common ass, cloaked in the skin of a lion. Its bray has revealed its true self, for a lion's roar is mighty and fearsome, not a humble donkey's call.\" The villagers, initially bewildered, now exchanged knowing glances, the truth dawning upon them.\n\nSummary:\nGovinda, a resourceful hawker, disguises his starving ass as a lion to steal villagers' crops, exploiting their fear. When the villagers confront the \"lion\" with noise, the ass's braying exposes its true identity, leading to its brutal demise. The story underscores the folly of pretense, as the ass's own voice betrays its deception, leaving Govinda heartbroken. The villagers' initial fear turns to anger, highlighting the consequences of hubris and the inevitability of truth.\n\nExisting Characters:\n- The Hawker\n- The Villagers (aliases: Watchmen)\n- The Ass\n\n\nOutput JSON with the following structure:\n{\n  \"doers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"receivers\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"character/item\", \"names\"],\n  \"new_characters\": [\n    {\"name\": \"name\", \"alias\": \"alias1;alias2\", \"archetype\": \"Hero\"},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Any notes about alias resolution or character matching\"\n}\n\nImportant:\n- If a character already exists (by name or alias), do NOT add it to new_characters\n- Use existing character names when matching\n- Items can be objects, magical agents, or prices\n- Be careful to resolve aliases correctly (e.g., \"孩子\" might already be in list as \"一儿一女\")\n", "input": "", "output": "{\"doers\": [\"The Future Buddha\"], \"receivers\": [\"The Villagers\"], \"new_characters\": [{\"name\": \"The Future Buddha\", \"alias\": \"Peasant; Wise Man\", \"archetype\": \"Mentor\"}], \"notes\": \"\"}"}
