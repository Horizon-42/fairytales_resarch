The air was thick with the aroma of cardamoms, saffron, and roasted spices, and platters laden with the richest delicacies, sweet laddoos, and fragrant curries stretched as far as the eye could see. Sun, the Eldest, with his boisterous hunger, devoured every morsel he could reach, thinking only of his own satisfaction. Wind, equally unrestrained, swept through the dishes, tasting and consuming without a moment's pause. But Gentle Moon, the Daughter, with her quiet grace and ever-thoughtful heart, carefully wrapped a small parcel of the finest sweets and a portion of fragrant rice in a fresh banana leaf, intending to bring it home for their dear Mother, Star, who had stayed behind to watch over the universe.\n\nSummary:\nIn a celestial realm, Sun, Moon, and Wind, children of Star, attend a lavish feast hosted by their uncle and aunts.
