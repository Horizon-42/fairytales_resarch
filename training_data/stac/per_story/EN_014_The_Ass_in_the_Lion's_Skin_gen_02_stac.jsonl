Unable to afford fodder for his beast, Govinda devised a cunning plan. He found the discarded, moth-eaten skin of a magnificent lion, which he carefully draped over his docile ass, tying it securely to make it appear like a fearsome predator. Each evening, under the cloak of twilight, he would lead the disguised ass into the lush paddy fields bordering a prosperous village, whose watchmen usually guarded the ripening crops. The sight of what appeared to be a lion, stalking silently through the moonlit fields, sent shivers down the spines of the fearful villagers, who dared not approach, allowing the ass to graze freely and fatten itself on their precious harvest, night after night.\n\nSummary:\nGovinda, a resourceful hawker, disguises his starving ass as a lion to steal villagers' crops, exploiting their fear. When the villagers confront the \"lion\" with noise, the ass's braying exposes its true identity, leading to its brutal demise.

Their murmurs of discontent eventually reached the ears of the village elders and the head watchman, who convened a council under the great banyan tree. \"We cannot let this lion devour our livelihood!\" declared a brave farmer, his voice trembling with a mix of fear and resolve. Galvanized by their collective grievance, the villagers decided to take a stand. They armed themselves not with weapons, but with whatever would make the loudest clamour: drums, conch shells, metal plates, and their own booming voices, agreeing to march towards the fields at dawn, hoping to scare away the terrifying creature with an overwhelming din.\n\nSummary:\nGovinda, a resourceful hawker, disguises his starving ass as a lion to steal villagers' crops, exploiting their fear.

Suddenly, a cacophony erupted – the booming of drums, the wailing of conch shells, the clanging of metal, and a thousand human shouts pierced the morning stillness. The disguised ass, startled by the unprecedented assault of sound, forgot its predatory role entirely.

It was then that a venerable peasant, known throughout the region as the Wise Man, a Bodhisatta, stepped forward, his eyes twinkling with ancient wisdom.
