One sweltering afternoon, while tending his parched patch of land, he noticed a magnificent cobra, its hood spread wide, coiled regally atop an old anthill at the edge of his field. Believing it to be the powerful Kshetradevata, the Guardian Deity of the Field, responsible for the land's fortunes, Haridatta's heart swelled with reverence and a desperate plea. He hurried home, fetched a bowl of cool, fresh milk, and humbly offered it to the majestic serpent, bowing low and imploring for bountiful crops and an end to his family's persistent hardship.\n\nSummary:\nHaridatta, a poor Brahman, offers milk to a cobra he believes is a deity, earning gold coins in return and lifting his family's fortunes. His greedy son, however, betrays the serpent by killing it, only to be fatally poisoned by its venom.

Instead, he concluded with greedy certainty that the entire anthill must be a secret repository of immense gold, and the Serpent was merely a guardian who, once removed, would yield a treasure beyond measure.
