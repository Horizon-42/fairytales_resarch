His fields yielded barely enough to feed his family, while the village's infamous Money-lender, a stout and cruel man named Sethji, grew fatter and richer each day, his mansion a testament to his exorbitant interest rates. One sweltering afternoon, driven by desperation, The Farmer approached Sethji, bowing low. \"Master,\" he pleaded, his voice thick with humility, \"you possess the secret to immense wealth. Please, in your great generosity, share with this poor man how one might find such fortune.\" The Money-lender, sneering at the Farmer's ragged attire, chuckled cruelly. \"Wealth, simpleton?
