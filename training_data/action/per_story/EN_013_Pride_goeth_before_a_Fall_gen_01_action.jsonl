Leading them was the shrewd and respected Clever Merchant, whose wisdom was as well-known as his honest dealings. Suddenly, from the dense thicket beside the road, burst forth the Three Robbers, infamous throughout the land for their brutality, often referred to as the Notorious robbers. With a terrifying roar, they descended upon the unsuspecting Traders. Resistance was futile; the merchants, peaceloving by nature, were quickly overwhelmed. The robbers, with ruthless efficiency, stripped every man of his precious wares, coin purses, and even the very clothes off their backs, leaving them shivering and destitute beneath the harsh sun.\n\nSummary:\nA caravan of eleven cloth merchants, led by the shrewd Clever Merchant, is robbed by the infamous Three Robbers, who force the traders to perform a humiliating dance. Using a cryptic trade song, the Clever Merchant subtly coordinates a coordinated attack, enabling the merchants to overpower the robbers and reclaim their stolen goods. Their triumph transforms them from victims to heroes, celebrated for their unity and ingenuity in overcoming tyranny.

They guzzled potent bhang from the merchants’ own recovered flasks, their laughter echoing cruelly across the barren landscape. \"What, no celebration, you naked wretches?\" one robber boomed, brandishing a stolen dagger. \"Dance for your lives!

He stepped forward, raising his voice above the crude jeers. \"Friends, let us lighten our hearts with an old Traders' song, a ditty from the bustling bazaars!\" he declared, and began to sing in a melodic, deceptively simple tune. His song, however, was laced with the familiar, rhythmic jargon of the cloth trade: \"Erith, enty, eno, the fabric is loose, erith, enty, eno, a knot to tie tight! Erith, enty, eno, strike when the moment is right, erith, enty, eno, take hold with all might!\" To the robbers, it was mere gibberish, an exotic accompaniment to their drunken revelry, but to the Ten Cloth Merchants, a flicker of understanding ignited in their eyes.\n\nSummary:\nA caravan of eleven cloth merchants, led by the shrewd Clever Merchant, is robbed by the infamous Three Robbers, who force the traders to perform a humiliating dance.

As the Leader sang the final, emphatic 'Erith, enty, eno, bind them up tight!', the traders, no longer helpless victims, sprang into action. They lunged at the astonished Three Robbers, using their collective strength. One robber, still reeling from the unexpected assault, stumbled over his own feet, another found his arms pinned by two determined merchants, and the third was wrestled to the ground.
