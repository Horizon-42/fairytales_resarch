One sweltering afternoon, while tending his parched patch of land, he noticed a magnificent cobra, its hood spread wide, coiled regally atop an old anthill at the edge of his field. Believing it to be the powerful Kshetradevata, the Guardian Deity of the Field, responsible for the land's fortunes, Haridatta's heart swelled with reverence and a desperate plea. He hurried home, fetched a bowl of cool, fresh milk, and humbly offered it to the majestic serpent, bowing low and imploring for bountiful crops and an end to his family's persistent hardship.\n\nSummary:\n\n\nDoers: Haridatta\nReceivers: The Serpent\n\n\nAction Categories (MUST select exactly one):\n- physical: attack, defend, restrain, flee, travel, interact, steal\n- communicative: inform, persuade, deceive, challenge, command, betray, reconcile, slander, promise\n- transaction: give, acquire, exchange, reward, punish, request, sacrifice\n- mental: resolve, plan, realize, hesitate, observe, investigate, plot, forget\n- existential: cast, transform, die, revive, cast_spell, express_emotion\n\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n- category MUST be exactly one of: \"physical\", \"communicative\", \"transaction\", \"mental\", \"existential\"\n- type MUST be selected from the corresponding category's options above (e.g., if category is \"physical\", type must be one of: attack, defend, restrain, flee, travel, interact, steal)\n- Do NOT invent new action types - use only the exact codes listed above\n- context can be freely generated or left empty, but prefer using recommended tags when applicable\n\nStatus (select one):\n- attempt, success, failure, interrupted, backfire, partial\n\nFunction (narrative role, or empty string):\n- trigger, climax, resolution, character_arc, setup, exposition, or empty string\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"category\": \"exact category code from: physical, communicative, transaction, mental, existential\",\n  \"type\": \"exact action type from the selected category's options (see guide above)\",\n  \"context\": \"context tag or empty string (can generate freely, but prefer recommended tags)\",\n  \"status\": \"one of: attempt, success, failure, interrupted, backfire, partial\",\n  \"function\": \"one of: trigger, climax, resolution, character_arc, setup, exposition, or empty string\"\n}\n\nCRITICAL:\n- category and type MUST use exact codes from the guide - do NOT invent new codes\n- type MUST match the selected category (e.g., if category=\"physical\", type must be one of its options)\n- If unsure, check the category's allowed types in the guide above", "input": "", "output": "{\"category\": \"transaction\", \"type\": \"sacrifice\", \"context\": \"\", \"status\": \"success\", \"function\": \"trigger\"}"}

The young man, observing his father's daily ritual and the sudden influx of wealth, began to harbor dark thoughts. His mind, clouded by avarice, dismissed the notion of divine generosity. Instead, he concluded with greedy certainty that the entire anthill must be a secret repository of immense gold, and the Serpent was merely a guardian who, once removed, would yield a treasure beyond measure.

The blow landed, but the resilient Serpent, though injured and enraged by the treacherous attack, was not killed. With a lightning-fast counterstrike born of pain and self-preservation, it sank its venomous fangs deep into the young man's arm.
