Among them was the Clever Merchant, their respected Leader, whose quick wit was as renowned as his exquisite silks. As the afternoon sun beat down relentlessly, a fearsome cry split the air. From behind a thicket of thorny scrub, three burly figures emerged, the notorious robbers who styled themselves the \"Three Monarchs\" of the highway. With menacing clubs and glinting daggers, they ambushed the unsuspecting traders, swiftly disarming them, stripping them of their rich turbans, fine kurtas, and even their humble dhotis, leaving them bare and vulnerable on the dusty ground beside their plundered wares.\n\nSummary:\n\n\nDoers: Three Robbers\nReceivers: The Clever Merchant\n\n\nAction Categories (MUST select exactly one):\n- physical: attack, defend, restrain, flee, travel, interact, steal\n- communicative: inform, persuade, deceive, challenge, command, betray, reconcile, slander, promise\n- transaction: give, acquire, exchange, reward, punish, request, sacrifice\n- mental: resolve, plan, realize, hesitate, observe, investigate, plot, forget\n- existential: cast, transform, die, revive, cast_spell, express_emotion\n\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n- category MUST be exactly one of: \"physical\", \"communicative\", \"transaction\", \"mental\", \"existential\"\n- type MUST be selected from the corresponding category's options above (e.g., if category is \"physical\", type must be one of: attack, defend, restrain, flee, travel, interact, steal)\n- Do NOT invent new action types - use only the exact codes listed above\n- context can be freely generated or left empty, but prefer using recommended tags when applicable\n\nStatus (select one):\n- attempt, success, failure, interrupted, backfire, partial\n\nFunction (narrative role, or empty string):\n- trigger, climax, resolution, character_arc, setup, exposition, or empty string\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"category\": \"exact category code from: physical, communicative, transaction, mental, existential\",\n  \"type\": \"exact action type from the selected category's options (see guide above)\",\n  \"context\": \"context tag or empty string (can generate freely, but prefer recommended tags)\",\n  \"status\": \"one of: attempt, success, failure, interrupted, backfire, partial\",\n  \"function\": \"one of: trigger, climax, resolution, character_arc, setup, exposition, or empty string\"\n}\n\nCRITICAL:\n- category and type MUST use exact codes from the guide - do NOT invent new codes\n- type MUST match the selected category (e.g., if category=\"physical\", type must be one of its options)\n- If unsure, check the category's allowed types in the guide above", "input": "", "output": "{\"category\": \"physical\", \"type\": \"steal\", \"context\": \"\", \"status\": \"success\", \"function\": \"trigger\"}"}

Their leader, a corpulent man with a scarred face, leered at the shivering merchants. \"Ha! What a pitiful sight!\" he bellowed. \"But even plucked pigeons can dance, can they not? Amuse us, you wretched traders! Dance for your masters!\" And so, with taunts and prods, the robbers forced the humiliated merchants to perform a grotesque dance, their bare feet shuffling awkwardly in the dust, their hearts heavy with despair and the sting of injustice.\n\nSummary:\n\n\nDoers: Three Robbers\nReceivers: The Clever Merchant\n\n\nAction Categories (MUST select exactly one):\n- physical: attack, defend, restrain, flee, travel, interact, steal\n- communicative: inform, persuade, deceive, challenge, command, betray, reconcile, slander, promise\n- transaction: give, acquire, exchange, reward, punish, request, sacrifice\n- mental: resolve, plan, realize, hesitate, observe, investigate, plot, forget\n- existential: cast, transform, die, revive, cast_spell, express_emotion\n\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n- category MUST be exactly one of: \"physical\", \"communicative\", \"transaction\", \"mental\", \"existential\"\n- type MUST be selected from the corresponding category's options above (e.g., if category is \"physical\", type must be one of: attack, defend, restrain, flee, travel, interact, steal)\n- Do NOT invent new action types - use only the exact codes listed above\n- context can be freely generated or left empty, but prefer using recommended tags when applicable\n\nStatus (select one):\n- attempt, success, failure, interrupted, backfire, partial\n\nFunction (narrative role, or empty string):\n- trigger, climax, resolution, character_arc, setup, exposition, or empty string\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"category\": \"exact category code from: physical, communicative, transaction, mental, existential\",\n  \"type\": \"exact action type from the selected category's options (see guide above)\",\n  \"context\": \"context tag or empty string (can generate freely, but prefer recommended tags)\",\n  \"status\": \"one of: attempt, success, failure, interrupted, backfire, partial\",\n  \"function\": \"one of: trigger, climax, resolution, character_arc, setup, exposition, or empty string\"\n}\n\nCRITICAL:\n- category and type MUST use exact codes from the guide - do NOT invent new codes\n- type MUST match the selected category (e.g., if category=\"physical\", type must be one of its options)\n- If unsure, check the category's allowed types in the guide above", "input": "", "output": "{\"category\": \"communicative\", \"type\": \"command\", \"context\": \"\", \"status\": \"success\", \"function\": \"setup\"}"}

He noticed their arrogance, their distraction, and the slight weariness in their posture from their drunken revelry. A cunning plan sparked in his mind. With a deep breath, he began to sing, his voice carrying a melancholic tune that seemed to lament their plight, yet within its rhythm, he wove words understood only by his fellow Traders. \"Erith, enty, eno, the wind it blows so low,\" he crooned, his eyes subtly flicking towards the nearest robber. \"Erith, enty, eno, a grip upon the foe!

Like a sudden gust of wind, they moved as one, their naked bodies surprisingly agile. One merchant tripped a robber with his foot, another seized a discarded club, and a third, with a surge of strength, tackled a villain, causing him to drop his dagger. In a whirlwind of swift, desperate movements, they overpowered the surprised robbers, using their own stolen dhotis and lengths of fine silk from their plundered bales to bind the struggling bandits securely, their pride now thoroughly humbled.\n\nSummary:\n\n\nDoers: Ten Cloth Merchants\nReceivers: Three Robbers\n\n\nAction Categories (MUST select exactly one):\n- physical: attack, defend, restrain, flee, travel, interact, steal\n- communicative: inform, persuade, deceive, challenge, command, betray, reconcile, slander, promise\n- transaction: give, acquire, exchange, reward, punish, request, sacrifice\n- mental: resolve, plan, realize, hesitate, observe, investigate, plot, forget\n- existential: cast, transform, die, revive, cast_spell, express_emotion\n\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n- category MUST be exactly one of: \"physical\", \"communicative\", \"transaction\", \"mental\", \"existential\"\n- type MUST be selected from the corresponding category's options above (e.g., if category is \"physical\", type must be one of: attack, defend, restrain, flee, travel, interact, steal)\n- Do NOT invent new action types - use only the exact codes listed above\n- context can be freely generated or left empty, but prefer using recommended tags when applicable\n\nStatus (select one):\n- attempt, success, failure, interrupted, backfire, partial\n\nFunction (narrative role, or empty string):\n- trigger, climax, resolution, character_arc, setup, exposition, or empty string\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"category\": \"exact category code from: physical, communicative, transaction, mental, existential\",\n  \"type\": \"exact action type from the selected category's options (see guide above)\",\n  \"context\": \"context tag or empty string (can generate freely, but prefer recommended tags)\",\n  \"status\": \"one of: attempt, success, failure, interrupted, backfire, partial\",\n  \"function\": \"one of: trigger, climax, resolution, character_arc, setup, exposition, or empty string\"\n}\n\nCRITICAL:\n- category and type MUST use exact codes from the guide - do NOT invent new codes\n- type MUST match the selected category (e.g., if category=\"physical\", type must be one of its options)\n- If unsure, check the category's allowed types in the guide above", "input": "", "output": "{\"category\": \"physical\", \"type\": \"attack\", \"context\": \"\", \"status\": \"success\", \"function\": \"climax\"}"}
