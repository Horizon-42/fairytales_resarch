His harvests were meager, his family often hungry, while the Money-lender, Sethji, grew fatter and richer each year, his mansion looming over the humble huts. One day, desperation gnawing at his heart, Govind approached Sethji, his voice meek yet earnest. \"Oh, revered Sethji,\" he pleaded, bowing low, \"you possess such immense wealth and fortune.

After a journey, Govind encounters Ram, who grants him a magical conch to fulfill wishes.
