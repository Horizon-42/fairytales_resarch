This precious grain, saved from his meager alms, he carefully stored in an old, unglazed earthen pot. He hung this pot from a peg on the wall of his simple dwelling, directly above his sleeping mat, so that it might always be within his watchful gaze. To him, this humble pot, brimming with its starchy treasure, represented not merely a meal, but the kernel of future prosperity, the bedrock upon which his grandest dreams would be built.\n\nSummary:\nSvabhavakripana, a miserly Brahman, hoards a small amount of rice in a pot, imagining it will grow into vast wealth and power. His fantasies of becoming a merchant king and controlling his family lead him to impulsively kick the pot, shattering it and losing his rice. The tale warns against unrealistic ambitions and neglecting the present, as his greed and overreach destroy his meager possessions.
