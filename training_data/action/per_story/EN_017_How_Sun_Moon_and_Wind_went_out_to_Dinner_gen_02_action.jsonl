The hall shimmered with divine light, tables groaned under the weight of ambrosial sweets, fragrant rice, and countless delicacies prepared with celestial love. Sun, with his radiant hunger, consumed dish after dish, his plate never empty, his focus entirely on his own indulgence. Wind, equally self-absorbed, darted from one delicacy to another, gulping down essences and devouring morsels with no thought beyond his fleeting desires. But Gentle Moon, ever thoughtful of her Mother Star, discreetly wrapped portions of the finest sweets and the most fragrant fruits in a large, cool lotus leaf, carefully preserving them amidst the joyous revelry, ensuring her mother would not be forgotten.\n\nSummary:\n\n\nDoers: Moon\nReceivers: Star\n\n\nAction Categories (MUST select exactly one):\n- physical: attack, defend, restrain, flee, travel, interact, steal\n- communicative: inform, persuade, deceive, challenge, command, betray, reconcile, slander, promise\n- transaction: give, acquire, exchange, reward, punish, request, sacrifice\n- mental: resolve, plan, realize, hesitate, observe, investigate, plot, forget\n- existential: cast, transform, die, revive, cast_spell, express_emotion\n\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n- category MUST be exactly one of: \"physical\", \"communicative\", \"transaction\", \"mental\", \"existential\"\n- type MUST be selected from the corresponding category's options above (e.g., if category is \"physical\", type must be one of: attack, defend, restrain, flee, travel, interact, steal)\n- Do NOT invent new action types - use only the exact codes listed above\n- context can be freely generated or left empty, but prefer using recommended tags when applicable\n\nStatus (select one):\n- attempt, success, failure, interrupted, backfire, partial\n\nFunction (narrative role, or empty string):\n- trigger, climax, resolution, character_arc, setup, exposition, or empty string\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"category\": \"exact category code from: physical, communicative, transaction, mental, existential\",\n  \"type\": \"exact action type from the selected category's options (see guide above)\",\n  \"context\": \"context tag or empty string (can generate freely, but prefer recommended tags)\",\n  \"status\": \"one of: attempt, success, failure, interrupted, backfire, partial\",\n  \"function\": \"one of: trigger, climax, resolution, character_arc, setup, exposition, or empty string\"\n}\n\nCRITICAL:\n- category and type MUST use exact codes from the guide - do NOT invent new codes\n- type MUST match the selected category (e.g., if category=\"physical\", type must be one of its options)\n- If unsure, check the category's allowed types in the guide above", "input": "", "output": "{\"category\": \"\", \"type\": \"\", \"context\": \"\", \"status\": \"\", \"function\": \"setup\"}"}
