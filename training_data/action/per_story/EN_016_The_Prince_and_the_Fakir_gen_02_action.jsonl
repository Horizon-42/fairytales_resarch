Despite all prayers and sacrifices, his queen remained barren. One day, a gaunt, enigmatic Fakir, his eyes burning with unnatural fire, appeared at the palace gates. He offered the despairing King a potent boon: two sons would grace his royal household, but in return, the King must promise to surrender the elder one to the Fakir's keeping when the time came.

The Princess, now fully understanding her earlier misjudgment, joyfully accepted his hand, and the Prince was crowned King, inheriting both his birthright and his newfound kingdom.\n\nSummary:\nA childless king, desperate for an heir, strikes a deadly pact with a mysterious Fakir, who demands his firstborn in exchange for two sons. When the king deceitfully substitutes slaves, the Fakir exposes the lie via ants, seizing the true prince, who escapes, defeats the Fakir, and frees magical creatures. The prince later reunites with his father, proves his worth through a legendary hunt, and ascends as king, winning the heart of the princess and uniting two realms.\n\nDoers: The King\nReceivers: The Prince\n\n\nAction Categories (MUST select exactly one):\n- physical: attack, defend, restrain, flee, travel, interact, steal\n- communicative: inform, persuade, deceive, challenge, command, betray, reconcile, slander, promise\n- transaction: give, acquire, exchange, reward, punish, request, sacrifice\n- mental: resolve, plan, realize, hesitate, observe, investigate, plot, forget\n- existential: cast, transform, die, revive, cast_spell, express_emotion\n\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n- category MUST be exactly one of: \"physical\", \"communicative\", \"transaction\", \"mental\", \"existential\"\n- type MUST be selected from the corresponding category's options above (e.g., if category is \"physical\", type must be one of: attack, defend, restrain, flee, travel, interact, steal)\n- Do NOT invent new action types - use only the exact codes listed above\n- context can be freely generated or left empty, but prefer using recommended tags when applicable\n\nStatus (select one):\n- attempt, success, failure, interrupted, backfire, partial\n\nFunction (narrative role, or empty string):\n- trigger, climax, resolution, character_arc, setup, exposition, or empty string\n\n\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"category\": \"exact category code from: physical, communicative, transaction, mental, existential\",\n  \"type\": \"exact action type from the selected category's options (see guide above)\",\n  \"context\": \"context tag or empty string (can generate freely, but prefer recommended tags)\",\n  \"status\": \"one of: attempt, success, failure, interrupted, backfire, partial\",\n  \"function\": \"one of: trigger, climax, resolution, character_arc, setup, exposition, or empty string\"\n}\n\nCRITICAL:\n- category and type MUST use exact codes from the guide - do NOT invent new codes\n- type MUST match the selected category (e.g., if category=\"physical\", type must be one of its options)\n- If unsure, check the category's allowed types in the guide above", "input": "", "output": "{\"category\": \"transaction\", \"type\": \"give\", \"context\": \"\", \"status\": \"success\", \"function\": \"resolution\"}"}
