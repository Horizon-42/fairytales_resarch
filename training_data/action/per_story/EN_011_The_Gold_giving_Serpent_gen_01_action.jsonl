His heart heavy with sorrow over his failing fortunes, one sweltering afternoon, he stumbled upon a large, glossy black serpent coiled regally atop an old anthill that marked the edge of his arid land. Believing it to be a Kshetrapala, a Guardian Deity of the Field, whose wrath might have caused his misfortunes, Haridatta’s spirit filled with a sudden, desperate hope. He hurried home, fetched a bowl of fresh, creamy milk, perfumed it with a sprinkle of sandalwood, and reverently placed it before the majestic serpent, bowing low and murmuring ancient prayers for appeasement and prosperity.\n\nSummary:\nHaridatta, a devout Brahman farmer, discovers a serpent he believes is a guardian deity and offers milk daily, earning gold coins that transform his impoverished life. His greedy son, however, plots to kill the serpent for its supposed treasure, leading to the son's death and the serpent's tragic departure. The serpent, though defending itself, breaks their bond, leaving Haridatta with a final pearl and eternal exile from their sacred connection.

As the unsuspecting serpent emerged, its scales gleaming, to receive its usual offering, the son raised his weapon and struck with all his might. Though the blow was aimed to be fatal, the swift serpent narrowly dodged the full impact, suffering a painful, glancing wound. In a flash of instinctual self-preservation, the enraged Guardian Deity lunged forward, sinking its venomous fangs deep into the son's arm.

Despite the immense pain, Haridatta’s deep-seated reverence for the serpent remained. The following morning, his eyes swollen with tears, he approached the anthill once more, placing the fresh milk offering as was his custom, hoping to somehow mend the broken bond. The serpent emerged, its gaze somber, and spoke, its voice like the rustling of dry leaves: \"Haridatta, how can I ever again trust you or your lineage?
